1/12/2021,"I purchased this product because of its name, ""Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch"" (the word ""Naturals"" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from ""Non-Genetically Modified Corn"". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say ""made with"" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the ""Daily Value"" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice ""out"" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."" BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO ""READ LABELS"" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED. I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN: * because I don't need extra calcium * because I don't believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer's health but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn and just on principal because I can't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it. I am very, very displeased with Amazon's incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done. *Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!",0,0.701829

15/11/2021,"Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon.",0,0.68751436

2/2/2022,"There are many workdays when I only have a few minutes for lunch or (all too often) dinner. On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little ""twigs"" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's ""standing"" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!",1,0.72432655
6/12/2021,"I ordered these chips due to other readers reviews being so good. In addition, my pregnant wife and I enjoy foods that are portioned and easy for taking on the go.

Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?

25/2/2022,"I love oatmeal for breakfast, but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix-ins that I usually don't have time. This instant granola is just about perfect. The only thing wrong with it is that it's a bit too sweet. When I don't have time to make oatmeal in the morning, I throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when I get to work.

You might be surprised by its much firmer texture (than popcorn) at first, but go through a couple, and if you're like me, you'll appreciate the quality crunch and just the right balance of sea salt! I was hooked so fast, I was just chugging the ziplock bag into my mouth for a mouthful of tasty treat, and no, didn't need to reseal the pouch! The spicy version is just as good - it isn't that spicy (it's ""slightly spicy"") and highly addictive. Try both and you will not go back to those greasy popcorns! Yay for Grandpa Po's!",1,0.7262292

Per servings totals are 200 calories, total fat 11g, saturated fat 8g, cholesterol 30 mg, sodium 540 mg! This sodium total is 22% of what you should get for the whole day! By comparison, Campbell's Chicken with Rice soup has 70 calories, total fat 1.5g, saturated fat .5g, cholesterol 5 mg, sodium 820 mg. Almost double the sodium (salt) but much healthier in every other category. The bottom line is, if you want healthy soup, make it yourself.",1,0.71472216

I learned that feeding your dogs the right food from an early age is key to keeping them healthy and with you for as long as possible. This by far is one of the best Natural foods I have purchased and my dogs just (Love) it.. The Holistic Primitive is high in Protein and very well tolerated by sensitive stomachs. This food has never been recalled and is made in it's own plant, unlike most major brands out there that are manufactured at the same plant and only under different names. The price I find to be fare, as I have paid much higher for other Holistic food which was not received well by my dogs.

We were very happy with it until the price went through the roof! We tried several different grain-free food over the next year or so. Some the dogs just didn't like. Some aggravated my Lhasa Apso's allergies. A couple of my dogs are susceptible to yeast infections and the EVO had curtailed that problem but it came back with other foods.

Since, I have never seen her gag from hairballs, not once! All of my cats come running when I open these treats. My favorites are the vitamins as well as the hairball and the regular plain I also love to feed them. They love them all! The ONLY other treats I feed usually are Pounce and Party Mix but Temptations are there favortires! I HAVE ABOUT 8 BAGS OF THESE IN MY CABINETS... Because I have a lot of treats! At the shelter I run, we keep all kinds of cats and kittens and we have about 35 right now and NONE have never had any problems with these treats to date. I am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available. I also love that they provide GREAT dental care and tarter control.

My mom and I pay the vet bills for any sick cats, we love cats!!! So far we have been blessed with wonderful healthy strays and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or Leukemia and we do vaccinate and have them tested.

19/2/2022,"For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value. I was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food. It absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside (and that's what it tastes/feels like). Another one of my favorites is the Mexican drink called: Chia fresca, which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade. You have to experience it yourself to know why it's so popular. One lb. added to liquid will create 10-14# of highly nutritious food. Chia seeds (best known for the chia pet) are high in protein, 5x the calcium of milk and high in Omega 3 oils. Chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in Mexico, south & central America and were the food of the Aztecs. I would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk, chia seeds & sweetener, but I don't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it's so fatty. (Can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup chia seeds & sweetener to taste) I make it with 2 cups of water, 4 scoops of whey protein, then I soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up, I add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener. Sometimes I cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin, cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding.",1,0.71885467
14/1/2022,"There are so many miracle health products out there it's hard to know what's for real. But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag. ***Health Benefits*** - extremely high concentration of omega-3 acids (more than salmon) - complete protein! What does that mean? I had to look it up too. :) It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs. So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive. Most veggies don't have that, meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body can't synthesize on its own. 1 serving (10g / 1 tbsp) = 2g protein -- higher than most other grains and seeds. Other plant sources with complete protein = quinoa, soybean, buckwheat & hempseed - good source of fibre & potassium & calcium - 3x the iron than spinach - low in cholesterol & sodium - doesn't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and doesn't have estrogen-like effects ***Uses & Taste*** Chia seeds taste pretty good! Rather, there's no strong taste the way sesame does, so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry, or a thicker jelly-like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit. Ideas for use: In a salad, added to smoothies, in a breakfast granola or yogurt, in oatmeal, used as an egg replacement in baked goods, on sushi, to make iskiate (chia fresca) -- a Tarahumara energy drink, or just straight up have a spoonful. I recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great. One thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth, so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them. :) ***This brand*** I haven't bought any other brand of chia seeds, but this one works so why switch? Seeds tasted fresh when I opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag. Bag is resealable, price on Amazon was better than in stores = a good buy. Overall I'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking...next kitchen experiment - lemon chia cupcakes! Bye bye poppy seeds!",1,0.57977235

As others have mentioned, they do swell up after they've been in liquid for awhile, but I've found that as long as I drink my smoothie within 10 minutes or so of making it, it's fine.

20/11/2021,"I was just starting to think about healthy foods, granola, fiber etc, and I already tried the ""Cascadian Farms Maple Brown Sugar Granola Cereal, 17-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)"" which isn't as healthy and great tasting as this!! If you know about Weight Watchers points, you'll know what I'm talking about next. I have one of those Weight Watcher cards from a few years back *ahem* and I calculated that 1 cup of this is only 2 points. (The granola cereal was 3/4 cup for 4 points) I didn't think they could make such a good cereal with such low points! It's those 9 grams of fiber! I love it! FYI - I paid $6.72 (with subscribe and save) for a box of 4. I like to post what I paid to help others in their decision at the time of purchase since prices change so frequently here. HAPPY EATING!",1,0.6871821
16/2/2022,I have a very fussy Yorksire terrier and a miniature schnauzer and both them absolutely love these treats. I give them to them after they finish their breakfast and they bark at me if I forget! I like the fact that they have no fillers or artificial ingredients because my dogs have food allergies.

1/2/2022,"We've tried Switch before, but the only flavor we were aware of was the citrus. That was good, but this Kiwi Berry flavor is far better. It's tart, but has sufficient sweetness to balance the tartness. Best of all, there are no unwanted ingredients in this. It's basically a carbonated fruit juice. There is no added sugar, or, worse, high fructose corn syrup. There are no artificial preservatives or colors or anything else that's typically added to a soda (or even a juice drink). The 8.3-ounce can is a good size, too.",1,0.72008395

Our girl likes their stuff--she's more partial to the rice cereal--and we like that it's organic and (fairly) unadulterated. Addition of DHA and probiotics a plus. If you can, try to find a sample portion or individual can for your child before committing to a large, 6-canister purchase, like this one.

17/11/2021,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food. We've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund goes CRAZY over the turkey/chicken grain free canned, but is a little slower with this salmon stuff. Fortunately he will eat anything I give him, so it wasn't a waste for me to buy a whole case of this too :-). He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. Also, we've had zero need for vet visits since I brought him home and his chronic upper respiratory issue completed cleared up within two weeks! I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!). I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!",1,0.7128088

We thought he didn't like them at first, but after a few tries he was not afraid of them anymore (these were his first non-pureed food) and now he crawls to the pak and begs for them and wants lots at a time.

I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for healthier snack foods - it's a winner in my book!",1,0.7241656
16/2/2022,"This is a really good dip for vegetables and pita. The only ingredients are eggplant, tahini paste, and salt, so it is pretty natural and basic. I took it to work and popped the can, which is highly convenient for travel since you don't need an opener. It tasted fine, but kind of bland. There's a bit of a smoky flavor. I mixed in some olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic like the can says to do (if I only I would read directions first) and its really good. I agree from the other reviewer that the consisency is quite think like hummus, but it is not made out of chickpeas. It isn't the same as the babaganoush I get at restaurants, but it is still good for a can product. I'm a big fan of eggplant if made properly. You also get alot for the price, I can make four meals out of this. I will definately buy again. I also bought the hummus from Alwadi.",1,0.7253953

16/2/2022,"We discovered these as one of the snacks sent by a diet my husband was on. They're good enough we then looked them up ourselves. They're cheaper per ounce in the larger bags, but the 1oz bags are great for potion control. All three flavors available on Amazon are delicious; my husband's favorite is the cracked pepper. The rosemary is a reasonably strong taste, so I would recommend liking rosemary if you order it. I make fat free 'hummus' to serve with them (no sesame/tahini or olive oil, so it's not quite traditional, but that's necessary to cut the fat). I just throw a can of chickpeas, juice from a lemon, salt, a handful of fresh cilantro, and varied roasted peppers & garlic in to the blender, until it's all mashed up good. Delicious combination.

When the health food department of my local supermarket discontinued carrying them, I quickly looked for an alternative supply, and here it is. By using auto-ship I am paying about half the cost of the supermarket. Thank you Ryvita for a great product. Thank you Amazon for great pricing and convenience.",1,0.7264039

But something that I found out when I first tried this cereal: don't pick out the chocolate pieces to eat separately because they'll taste funny to you. You have to eat the cereal all together because the flakes have a little chocolatey flavor to them and it adds to the flavor of the chocolate pieces. So if you love Special K and chocolate, you should give this cereal a try.",1,0.71485144

Amaranth flakes are delicious, too. The nuggets (discontinued many years ago) were even tastier. If you're looking for something good to eat, something that's not going to upset your stomach, something that you're going to look forward to eating every day, give amaranth products a try.

4/2/2022,"Many of my family members can not tolerate gluten so while visiting one of them, I tried these crackers. I really like them. No, they don't taste like a Ritz(tm), but that is not the flavor I am after anyway. When I read the label, I know what all the ingredients are. The herb flavor is not strong. Even after the package is open for weeks, they still taste fresh. If I made my own crackers, this is what they would taste like.",1,0.7238622

24/1/2022,"I grew up with chestnuts and for years I roasted my own (seasonally) and had to deal with what I found inside (good or rotten) after roasting them. Well, no more roasting for me! I now can eat chestnuts anytime and these taste just as good as roasting them yourself after you've put them in the microwave on high for about 15 seconds. I also find the flavor very good. Although the darker color took some getting used to, it makes no difference to the chestnut flavor at all. I found them moist. However, chestnuts are a drier nut. (My grandfather always ate them with his wine!) Chestnuts are also part of my diet. They're low in calories, no cholesterol or fat and have a lot of Vitamin C and some iron even. Much better than any other nut to munch on IMHO. I was buying these at my local grocery store, but due to the Christmas season, they're out. If they don't restock, I'll be buying them again on-line.

6/1/2022,"I love finding new healthy snacks that I can keep stashed in places (like my desk at work and study area at home). I don't see the stats listed here anywhere, so here they are in case you're looking for them like I was: Serving Size 1 bar: 246 calories, 14g total fat, 12g sat fat, 0 trans fat, 32mg sodium, 33g carbs, 3.8g fiber, 29g sugar, 1.4g protein. What I love: High fiber, delicious flaky coconut and a few crunchy almonds, and very low sodium. These are absolutely delicious if you like coconut. The fat content seems a little high (as does the sugar) but it is a natural occurring fat and not bad for you like other grease and oils (the same with the sugar). Only THREE INGREDIENTS. I can't stress enough how great it is to flip over the bar and see that coconut, rice syrup and almond are the only ingredients listed. They are also fairly inexpensive, so I don't mind buying them to keep around, most flavors come out to less than $1 per bar. What I don't love: The carbs being a little high, I would only eat these earlier in the day. The protein being so low means I have to have it with something else that is high protein so that I stay full. However, these would go fantastic with some vanilla soy or low-fat cows milk to help that out. Neither of these things are enough for me to take a star away or not order again.

MSG adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor. Not so with this product!! It is so good - I use it wherever and whenever I can. I am finding that I do not have to use very much so it goes quite far. I now have the vege, beef and chicken flavored versions and they are all good. MMMMMMM...happy tummy!",1,0.6973483

They are nice and cruncy with just enough brown sugar sweetness to be tasty without overpowering your taste buds. Sometimes I mix them 50-50 with the cinnamon flavored and have a nice brown sugar & cinnamon flavor. Also, it's nice and hearty so it doesn't leave me hungry after only 30 minutes.

Ease of making - let the tea bag steep in the water for 20-30 seconds. shake it three times and throw away the tea bag. Do not squeeze the water out of the tea bag. You've already gotten all the flavor and antioxidants from the tea. Then take the pouch the tea bag came in and turn upside down on top of your cup and flick a couple of times to add the powder that was left in the pouch to your tea.

4/12/2021,"Amazon offered Apple Cinnamon and Golden Honey Graham Crackers as part of their Amazon Vine program. As someone who likes Graham Crackers this offer was irresistible. Both sets of Graham Crackers arrived yesterday. Packaging: The Graham Crackers arrived in sturdy cardboard boxes with sealed thick plastic bags inside each box. The boxes are reusable so the crackers are easy to store in the pantry. Texture: Unlike some Graham Crackers these crackers are not super crumbly. They hold together, the package actually contained crackers instead of crumbs. Taste: If you like Graham Crackers, you will like both the Golden Honey and Apple Cinnamon Graham Crackers by Back To Nature. Taste is very good, not too sweet yet very pleasant. One of the better Graham Crackers that I have enjoyed. Healthy ingredients: - Whole Grain (Wheat and Oats!) 19g in Apple Cinnamon and 20g in Golden Honey. - Sea Salt (I have seen research indicating that sea salt raises blood pressure less than normal refined salt) - No High Fructose Corn Syrup (High Fructose is associated with early aging of the skin) - No hydrogenated Oils (Hydrogenated oils tend to clog the arteries) - No artificial Preservatives, flavors or colors.

2/1/2022,"Graham Crackers may not seem like something that needs reinvented. As a child, I always thought of them somewhere between eating a cookie and a saltine cracker, though much closer to a cookie, since they were part of a quick desert rotation. Like anything else, some are better than others, whether just lacking a clear taste or enough cinnamon sugar coating. I decided to give Back to Nature's Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers a chance. The front of the box boasts 100% Natural and no artificial ingredients or high fructose corn syrup. They're also made with whole wheat and oats, which I thought would make them more substantial than something made by Nabisco or Keebler. But would they taste like the recycled paperboard box they came in? They are delicious, with a balance of evaporated cane juice and honey that prevents the grains from overpowering. They're good enough for a snack or dessert, but be careful, or you may eat a whole package, they're that satisfying! I would be happy to add these into my diet, which yes, does involve whole grains.",1,0.5424013

18/12/2021,"I've been a huge fan of Coconut Secret products for a while now and buy their coconut nectar, crystals and aminos in bulk. So not surprisingly I expected to love their new bars and -- no surprises -- I did. I've tried both the Classic Coconut and Mint varieties now and this is my favorite of the two by far. As with the Classic Coconut, the chocolate coating is a bit on the melty side, not hard and waxy like a conventional chocolate bar, so don't leave them in the heat for too long. The mint flavor is perfectly balanced -- not too harsh, not too mild or understated. The cacao nibs add a crunch and texture that's irresistible. In fact, something about the combination of crunchy bits and mint flavor reminds me of mint Girl Guide cookies. Yum! They have that kind of ""cookie crunch"" taste and texture. But of course these contain no junk. They're not as sweet as a regular chocolate bar, are low-glycemic and contain under 300 calories per bar. These are simply delectable. I can't wait to try the other two flavors in the line. Be advised that if you're looking for a Mounds bar, you should buy a Mounds bar. Don't expect this to be an exact replica. But they are as delicious and healthy an alternative as you're going to find.",1,0.7059169

Some of those flavor enhancers that you find in other food can be found in shampoo and conditioner and those companies will say that they're flavor enhancers when it reality those artificial things keep them fromturning rancid.

25/1/2022,I had been drinking green tea because I'd read it was very good for you. It took me a while to acquire a taste for it but eventually I came to really like it & drink it throughout the day at work. But recently I had some surgery & was told by my doctor to stop drinking green tea for a few weeks prior to my procedure. I'd also read where black tea has the same healthful properties as green tea. My doctor said black tea would not interfere with my surgery so I bought some. It's a similar taste to green tea but stronger. It gets strong very quickly when steeping so if you prefer a lighter taste I would recommend pulling the teabag out pretty quickly. But I like it.

25/1/2022,"I've read many places and heard Dr. Oz say that the only oatmeal that really has the health benefits is steel cut oats. I just love this stuff. I make a large amount and eat it cold all week. I use 8 cups of water, 1/2 cup non-fat dry milk, mix it, bring to a boil, and then dump in 2 cups of the oats. Stand by the pot and keep stirring so it doesn't overflow the pot or stick to the bottom. I love the flavor and the sort of crunch. It would also be good with dried cranberries and some walnuts or slivered almonds. It's a few pennies cheaper at Trader Joe but they don't always have it. I've been eating it every day and thoroughly love it. EDITED TO GIVE A GREAT AND EASY WAY TO COOK STEEL-CUT OATS: After a few batches, I have perfected this stovetop technique for steel-cut oats: 1. boil 4 cups of water in a pot on the stove (optional: 1/2 cup non-fat dry milk to up the calcium) 2. add 1 1/2 cups of steel-cut oats 3. bring to rolling boil again 4. cover tightly and let it keep boiling for a few seconds 5. turn off flame and forget about it. It doesn't take too long, under 1/2 hour I think but not sure, and the water is totally absorbed and you have the perfect combination of creamy/chewy steel-cut oats. You get enough for quite a few servings; not sure how many. 10 maybe?? Nothing stuck to the bottom of the pot. What a delight. Much better than standing over the pot and stirring and much better than cooking in a slow cooker. (Learned this on egullet!)",1,0.72363704

You have to be a dark chocolate fan to enjoy this, but I've always preferred dark chocolate, and I seek out those chocolates with the highest concentration of cocoa (at least 87%).

31/1/2022,"My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted. First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information. Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them. Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness. All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .",1,0.6950528

I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all. As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.

You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also. Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are. The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor. These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste. If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.

It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten. I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!! The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel. So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too. I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine. Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER! I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat. Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream. It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it. When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream. It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch.",0,0.7083761

22/1/2022,"I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store EDIT: Oct 11, 2012 *****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase***** So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth. Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't ""terrible"" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.",1,0.5710843

My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences. Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step.

25/1/2022,The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own The salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME. Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 calories The sour cream and onion is a little chemicall-y but decent. The barbeque is good but not tasty enough. The flavor doesn't go as well with the texture. Haven't yet tried the other two flavors. Will update as I do. If you haven't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes. Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat. So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active. These definitely beat a 150 - 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack.,1,0.72739035

5/1/2022,"I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a ""diet"" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being ""too salty"" or ""high in sodium"". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.",1,0.7211788

28/12/2021,"I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out. To me, this product tastes great. I am thrilled to get something unsweetened. I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast. I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh! Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly). The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything. It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time. So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along. That works for me, no complaints.

2/11/2021,"I am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black; nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee. As a result of this habit I find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes. As a general rule I prefer an Arabica bean but I could not find a reference to bean type on the bag. Curious I checked their web site and found they use the Arabica bean exclusively. On the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the Rivera Sunset coffee; the Swiss water process is used. Their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine: ""Unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the water-soluble caffeine present in the beans, as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water. The water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water. This decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans, allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee. Finally, the coffee is dried and ready for roasting."" More information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process; I found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out. Another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee; I've found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee. Let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself. First it is very smooth and rich; I almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice. That is very rare! The coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which I found pleasing. I did face one challenge with this coffee; the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it. After working on it for several minutes, I had decided I was not going to let a bag beat me, I discovered that I was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back. Once I got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy. Fortunately the two small tears I made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed. The bag recommends storage in a refrigerator. This coffee is pleasant and refreshing and I have enjoyed drinking it; if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think.

So this was a real treat - outstanding aroma just opening the bag, and even better when brewing. Delightfully smooth taste, and highly drinkable black (the only way I drink coffee or tea). My only complaint is opening the bag. Based on what other reviewers stated, I opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills. Very glad I did - an appreciable amount was spilled when I cut into the bag. I decanted it into an air-tight container.

Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink.

I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants. The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12) . I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy!",1,0.7248175

16/2/2022,"Hubby and I both have teeth that can't handle anything too seedy or hard. I also lost 81 lbs (so far) doing a lower carb diet (not LOW, but LOWER). I pretty much skip bread these days--and cereal, etc--but I don't mind using up some of my starch/carb calories on these. So versatile. To dip. To make cracker sandwiches. To use breakfast type spreads on (when a craving for bagels/toast hits). I love them with hummus, with cheese, cracked over soup, topped with egg salad, with neufchatel and sugar-free preserves (I use Nature's Hollow). They are so nice to have with my breakfast omelettes. Even my super picky hubby likes them. We both adore the texture. Oh, man. How perfect. The lightness that preserves a nice, gentle crispness. Wasa, please don't ever stop making these. I like this one and the mild rye. Both are now staples here. Satisfy my bread needs without a ton of carbs. And since I restrict myself to 1200 calories, two of these do little damage to my eating plan at 20 calories each. I also like to watch my sodium (middle-aged and almost off blood pressure meds), and these don't pack on the salt. Thumbs up! Now, if they could make one that's like an everything bagel--an everything crispbread light and crispy version with the onion/garlic/sesame seed/poppyseed. How cool would that be? (Or maybe they already have, dunno.) Update: I don't eat gluten anymore, so I don't buy this product these days. For those who don't care about grains/gluten, I can still recommend it based on texture/taste/calories. But not for me as I'm trying to stay gluten-free. Be well...",1,0.59751254

Rice, with some vegetables mixed in, also some chicken. The chicken and veggies are chopped up into small pieces, and all of it is cooked in a pan, and served warm. It is really good, but what really makes it is the Salsa Lizano, which used to be on every table in Costa Rico, now you may have to ask for it, as it is really popular. This salsa is great on cabbage, chicken, rice dishes, just about anything. I always made a point of bring a bottle or two home with me, as it was not possible to purchase anywhere in America.

When I was about 10 years old, I absolutely thought they were average at best and couldn't understand what everyone loved so much about them. ""Too sour, not tasty enough"" was my impression. Later however, I entered my teenage years and it actually took until I nearly graduated from high school that the taste caught on with my tastebuds and became super delicious to me. What also got me hooked is this kid I remember from 10th grade science class who would ALWAYS bring in a bag of Skittles *every single day* and chew on them, and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality, so Skittles sort of gave me the impression that COOL kids eat Skittles. However, please buy bags of Skittles from your local grocery store- it's not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price. You can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices. My only complaint with Skittles is that, despite the color, they *all* taste exactly the same to me! Purple, green, red, orange, yellow... I really can't taste a difference between these supposed ""different flavors"".

I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here. I know this isn't an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can't reconcile the taste with the ingredients.

10/11/2021,"This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda. While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect. Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces). Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda. Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas. This drink is basically juice with carbonation. The other notable issue I had with this was its size. 8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this. The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste. Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories. This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content. And I wouldn't give this to my kids. Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them. Not recommended, sorry.",0,0.5824392

This is made from 100% juice, so great for adult (Or kids') lunches, picnics, etc. A great drink for exercise as well, and doesn't have the sugar in it, so no spikes in blood sugar...

Now I'm curious about the other flavors to see if they taste better. However, I do have to say if you're expecting something extremely sweet, this is not the drink to get. You may want to go buy Kool-Aid for that. This drink has a natural taste to it. I can actually taste the mixture of orange and tangerine.

It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated' and 'no preservatives', so I was expecting some sweet ~ this drink tastes like carbonated, watered-down orange juice, but it's actually a pretty good flavor, and packs 140 calories, 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink! I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE a bit more natural, and this one, like I said above, tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine ~ it's nice tasting, but too much in the way of calories & such for me to drink this very often. It was certainly good, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda a year ago(I very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now) this is not the drink for me. I mostly drink water, milk, iced tea, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!

I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues. Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems. 34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.

Her doctor's only objection was that it was low in Folic Acid and tended to dehydrate babies. Well, Meyenberg Powdered Milk is fortified with Folic Acid, so dilute it with a little extra water and you're in business! I now have the happiest infant you've ever seen. Enfamil can take that nasty chemical soup they call formula and shove it, I'll never go back.

20/11/2021,"I bought this mainly because another review (can't remember if it was on Amazon or another site) said it was better than Morningstar Farms crumbles and because it is GMO free. Now, I've been a vegetarian since I was thirteen (and that was decades ago), but I am the sort that DOES want fake meat resembling meat. I've little interest in a mushroom-quinoa burger; I want a meaty-yet-vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side. Also, I'm a professional chef, so I'm very picky about the foods I eat. I'm saying this because I think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review. Tonight, I used the Harmony Valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese. I also did the same recipe with the MF crumbles to compare. Two things I was curious about: 1) flavor: they're *kind of* about the same, especially considering I was adding a browned mirepoix, marmite, and veg Worcestershire ... I guess I should fry up a patty of just the HV mix, but I did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay, but blander than MF 2) texture: MF wins. It just does (sorry, MF haters). It has larger pieces with a more meat-like texture. Plus, even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove, the HV was too wet. Now, the reviewer who also liked it better than MF also said something about it holding together on its own and that MF doesn't. Well, that's true. This was thick and stuck to itself, much more like the texture of ground meat - if you were to puree it. I use MF often in meatballs, and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese. I guess that's the difference; I don't just want to thaw or add water and *poof* have dinner. I expect to cook with an ingredient, the same as I would with real beef. So I wasn't bowled over in those ways, but I liked it. HV hamburger mix is good and I'm sure it will be useful, which is also a plus - no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles, you've got a half dozen packets at home. I have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living, so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home. And although I've seen some reviews complaining about the 15-20 wait for the HV mix to absorb water in the fridge ... really? Those people can't wait half an hour for a burger? If you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup, buy a frozen burger. I think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and I look forward to trying! Addendum: After eating the lasagna made with the HV mix, both my husband and I experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain. I'm apparently a glutton for punishment, though, because I decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday. Not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones (made with MF crumbles and Lightlife sausage), they had a sort of rubbery texture that I really did not care for. But, blander and texture I can overlook, except AGAIN, the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas. Ugh!",1,0.6864247

Next I tried a blackberry, blueberry, pomegranate seed....they were sweeter, but I wasn't blown away by how ""good"" they tasted, just surprised at how my taste buds have changed. Next up, a lemon!

Everything is fermented in vinegar and it is DELICIOUS!). The vinegar taste was gone, but the spiciness remained. Interesting.

I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas. I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way.

It did nothing to improve my health and the lack of improvement in my blood work supports this. So I am no longer going to buy it.

I had the worst case of heartburn at 10 weeks along, and after not being able to eat dinner and 4 tums, it wasn't getting any better. My best friend just bought me the Earth Mama Angel Baby tea sampler the other day and I had a lightbulb moment, remembering the heartburn tea was in there. I figured it was worth a shot, not having eaten dinner and feeling nauseous and miserable. Within a half an hour, the tea helped me to let out a couple of good burps and the hearburn finally eased. I'm not usually so excited about something to go out and write a review, but am hoping this might help some other mamas 2 be in need as well. I am putting in an order to get some more of this today. Will be good to have a box on hand at home and at work. The taste is very nice too, so I am beyond pleased!",1,0.697396
15/1/2022,"Although I eat a ton of fruits/veg, I have to admit I was looking for a ""quickie"" fiber boost, and I wanted to avoid psyllium because of the phytic acid properties that block absorption of certain medications and supplements (I take many of the latter). Sprouting reduces phytic acid, and is recommended by many in the nutrition communities for ""safely"" preparing oatmeal, barley, etc. So I got the sprouted Navitas brand chia powder shown here, but at Whole Foods. I have to say...this stuff is terrific. I put 3 TBs (1 serving) in about 1/4 cup of warm filtered water, and stirred it, and watched as it kind of puffed up...tasted it...and you know what? It kind of tasted like oatmeal or barley. I intended to add this slurry into my green smoothie, but I liked the way it tasted so much, I just ate it with a spoon. My recommendation is to add a little warm water to the powder, and stir it up before mixing it into whatever you are eating--or just eat it straight as I did. I'm going to buy this brand in bulk at Amazon--and I'll make sure it is the sprouted powder and not the seeds. By the way, I read on a review posted about the Navitas chia SEEDS that they make a kind of ""tapioca"" by adding coconut or almond milk and stevia to the chia seeds...so I tried doing that with the powder...it created a kind of soft, puffy pudding texture, and it was definitely in the ""treat"" category.",1,0.5769578

8/3/2022,"I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip. Lets talk about details: Chip thickness (+) These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays. Grease (+) These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil. Flavor (+) Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food. Resale (+) You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit. Overall: These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do. Thanks for reading my review.",1,0.72531396

21/1/2022,"I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant. I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years. I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway. I was not impressed. The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours. Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry. Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of. However what I cannot stand is an after taste. The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie. I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours. I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste. I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste. I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies. I find these two brands superior to Lucy's. Thanks for reading.",1,0.6460186

27/1/2022,"I LOVE ripe green olives, but do not often buy them, because I cannot eat less than a can at a time. Lindsay olives are what they are: Very distinct from typical American stuffed queen olives. No vinegar. Only slightly salty. With a mild nutty flavor. To me, they most closely resemble ripe black olives---but milder. If you like olives but are on a low-salt diet, and perhaps mostly use them in salads, or even sliced on pizza, Lindsay Olives are terrific, as is the price. For a delicious spread, microwave cream cheese for about 1 minute in a ~24 oz glass bowl (such as Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid ) to soften it, then mix-in coarsely chopped Lindsay Green Ripe olives. To make a dip, add a tablespoon of milk and mix. For snacking, or as a light meal with cheese and fruit, Lindsay Pitted Ripe Green Olvies are a faint shadow of the truly wonderful genre of ""California ripe green olives"". Unfortunately, the only brand you are likely to find outside California is Grabers olives, Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can . Grabers are the Rolls Royce of ripe green olives, and are priced accordingly. About $1.50 per olive including shipping to the East Coast, perhaps $1 per olive if you buy them by the case directly from Grabers. What's the difference? Bigger, better olives to begin with, PITS, and careful processing. The pits make a huge difference in any olive---they impart a nutty flavor to the flesh. In the case of Grabers, the flaver is nutty and buttery. If you want to impress your guests at a buffet, serve Grabers---and go for the big size 16 olives. They'll cost you about $2 each (i.e., per olive), but are worth it. Unfortunately, Lindsay does not sell unpitted olives. I also recommend Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag and Byzantine Pitted Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag Both are nice mixes of unpitted olives, without hot-peppers or other excessive flavoring.",1,0.7213715

In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.

2/1/2022,"I tried both this brand and the Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce brand of ghee because as far as I can tell these are the two brands that are from completely grass fed cows, which I was elated to see because of the health and flavor benefits. I'll say that this one takes the slight edge in the taste and aroma department. It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it's slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature. That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor. There is also a chance I am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor.

20/1/2022,"I was recently introduced to the Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy Picante, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20) and it was the best ""instant"" Ramen I've ever tried. I immediately ordered a case of those and these Spicy Chicken bowls. The perfect convenient chicken soup when you have a cold. Less than 5 minutes from grabbing the bowl to slurping soup. This is not that stuff you ate in college. This is a good sized serving of tasty noodles. You pay a little more for the disposable plastic bowl, but the convenience it great.",1,0.7235186

My husband and I have been trying to find these sold locally. Until then, we'll get them here, from Amazon. This is one of the best (and tastiest) items I've ever reviewed. Kiwi Berry is the only flavor we have tried thus far. We look forward to trying most of the others.",0,0.56123084
2/2/2022,"Please excuse the beginning of this review being the same as my review for Black Cherry, but the facts are the same. What is ""Switch,"" a new refreshing drink that will dazzle you. The can is colorful, 8.3 oz, not a large drink, and has a catchy saying - ""100% of what you want 0% of what you don't."" What does that mean? According to the can there is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, no corn syrup, and it is 100% juice carbonated. Now, this is definitely a break-thru for those with allergies and those looking for a more 'healthy' drink. especially for our children. But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste. Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, and our children definitely will not drink it, and that's just the honest truth. KIWI BERRY SWITCH Now, here is a flavor that I could get use to in a hurry. This taste was bubbling with flavor and actually brought pleasure to my taste-buds. It was rich and smooth, yet bursting with excitement at the same time. It did not leave an after taste that was unpleasant, but left you wanting more. The blending of the flavors in this Switch was excellent and definitely made this taster happy.I had my grandchild take a drink and she absolutely loved it and asked me to go purchase some. I recommend this flavor. Truly a treat for the taste buds. Very good.",1,0.7223502

1/2/2022,"Wow! i was pretty surprised at how well this actually turned out! i had my doubts about the texture mostly, but combining with water really works! i also tried with milk and cream(kinda defeats the purpose XD), and it only does a little for texture and taste. I wouldnt compare the taste to that of natural or organic PB though, as it tastes more like Skippy, Peter Pan, and Jiffy. My favorite is combining 2Tbsp PB2 with 1Tbsp of regular, but im so happy that i can finally snack on peanut butter without worrying about the calories! Also doesnt sit in your stomach like regular peanut butter can. Over a great product and i will continue to get it!",1,0.7186186

19/2/2022,Decided to buy one after using at my uncle's house. Absolutely love it except for the cup size. The larger mug option doesn't fill up a travel cup. I have to brew one cup of the larger and then one cup of the smaller for the travel cup to fill up. I use the same k cup and the coffee to water ratio is perfect for me. I also bought the reusable cups for the machine but find that they don't work very well and tend to waste coffee. It doesn't brew a strong enough cup. Maybe I have not perfected the grinds. I'll stick to my press for the weekend and k cups for the weekday. I love how quickly it brews and the temperature is perfect. I do wish the resevoir was larger though. It is a pain in the butt having to refill constantly. You do have to run it a few times when first using as the other reviews say. There is a strong plastic smell that took about 5 brews to get rid of.,1,0.7187278

Well I found them at Whole Foods, bought a bag - then I ended up ordering a case since I don't live near a WF & I wanted them to be my snack of choice. Anyway, my VERY picky 13 year old daughter really like them. They really taste like pretzels not like the gluten-free/high protein ones. My only complaint, dare I say it is, they need more salt! Even sesame seeds would be good they need a little something more. I don't think I will order a case soon b/c that's a lot of pretzels(!) but am hoping the word gets out and health food stores close to me would start carrying them so I can buy just a bag or two.",0,0.5173203
7/2/2022,I use 3 bags for 2 quarts and my family loves this tea. Not too sharp and never as bitter as some of the other teas are. Remember to add sugar while the tea is still hot to keep it crystal clear (if you like sweet tea) I make it in the evening to enjoy the next day.,1,0.72333544

I found Oregon Chai mix at a local grcoery (then later I found a cheaper bulk 3-box pack at a grocery warehouse store), and I tried it. It can't be compared to a professionally made Chai (at least the way I make it), but it totally satisfies my requirement to be able to make it at home anytime I want. Bear in mind, I use Rice Dream instead of real milk, but it still qualifies as something that I can call a decent Chai drink conveniently made at home. Extremely easy to make: you use 50% of this mixture and 50% of whatever kind of milk you use. And heat it up.",0,0.5631357

23/11/2021,"I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying.",1,0.72625685

Since they aren't refrigerated, they are drier.

It leaves a minty, menthol aftertaste, which I love. Taste is so subjective...if what I've written entices you, I'd give it a try.

13/2/2022,I read the reviews before I bought so I prepared by purchasing a small fine strainer before they arrived. I did notice the funky fishy smell when I opened the package and dumped the noodles into the strainer. I rinsed them and gave it another sniff and couldn't smell it anymore. I let them drain for a few while I made my sauce. Then I tossed the noodles in the sause to coat them and gave it a try. I was suprised to say the least. The noodles taste like nothing! All I could taste was the sauce. The texture isn't bad at all; I like rice noodles and these are similar in appearance and texture. I am very pleased and will make these a regular ingredient in my meals. To cut a bowl of pasta from 300-400 calories down to 30-60 is just awesome.

I looked it up on Amazon, and, there it was...six boxes at a time, on subscribe and save, a decent price, and quick delivery!

My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his ""pre-sleep"" tea of choice. I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice). Stash teas are great overall. I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a ""foil"" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!

I guess that next time I'm in that area, I'll simply be cleaning out their available stock.

Made in Australia, stored on a shelf, put on close-out, and traveled around in my bag for awhile... not even close to expiration, but still... it has been around. I expected a mediocre nut bar. Not so. It's so good I felt compelled to look online for more. Looking over the ingredients list, nothing stands out as ""The Flavor"" that makes these so tasty, so I'll just leave it at that.

My only complaints are that the ground seems a little coarse for espresso (although you wouldn't know it after brewing, the crema is excellent!), and that there isn't a whole bean version, which would be a very nice addition for espresso lovers.

15/11/2021,"I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try. We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content. Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food. Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant. You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball. It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog. We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it. The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing. It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it. The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left. We will definitely be buying more of these. Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat. Highly recommended!",0,0.57120156
19/2/2022,"These bars are very tasty. And I got a low sales price so they were much less overpriced than such bars usually are. But I consider them to be more like slightly-less-sweet cookies than like health bars -- not that there's anything wrong with that. They come two thin ones per pouch, so though you get 72 total, there are only 36 pouches. And most people would consider one pouch to be one serving, so you're getting 36 servings here, not 72. Also, the bars are extremely crumbly so I suggest having something underneath when you eat them to catch all those crumbs (or have a cordless vacuum handy if you eat these in the car).",1,0.7220497

This kit is for when one does NOT have that time, money, and dedication. It also has some rather odd- as French onion soups go- but flavorful additions such as carrots and tiny lentils. However, when made up it is easy and very good; it does not taste like it was made from a mix; it does have a lot of onion flavor- rather the point of FOS; and the added ingredient list is not excessive (to my recollection, it calls for a sauteed sweet onion in butter, 6 cups low-sodium beef broth, apple juice, and Worcestershire sauce). I served it with gruyere toasts: pieces of italian bread, toasted, with gruyere melted onto them, as a nod to the classic ""croutons"",and my family liked it very much.

8/11/2021,"You know, for a convenience meal, this is quite tasty. I was quite pleased with the flavor and ease of preparation. For the record, the box contains a packet of seasonings, elbow macaroni, and a package of cheese sauce. You add one pound of ground beef, although I believe you can cut down on that a bit if you want. I found the seasonings well balanced, enough for adults but not too much for kids, so something the whole family could eat and enjoy. I did not detect any strange chemical undertones as are sometimes found in packaged meals. It was very simple to make. When I come across a meat sale, I divvy it up so I always have some one-pound portions of beef in the freezer. So I took one out, defrosted it a bit in the microwave, and browned it in a skillet while I was doing other things. Then add two cups of water and the package of spices, let it boil up, then cover and simmer 11 to 13 minutes. I timed mine at 12 minutes and that was a bit too long for the noodles. I would recommend sampling the noodles at 10 minutes and judge from there. Then turn off the heat and add the cheese sauce -- yes, thankfully, it's a sauce, not dried powder. The box says it makes five one-cup servings. That makes at least four adult-sized servings, maybe five depending on side dishes. The leftovers went to the office for lunch and were good microwaved, although I first added a few drops of water to keep it from getting too dry.

The Velveeta package is what confuses me here, because as soon as you add it to the noodles it seems to disappear and you're left with plain noodles and hamburger.

Maybe I'm hypersensitive because I don't normally eat foods that are high in sodium content. Everyone's palate is different and perhaps you may not find this to be the case at all. However, those who are sensitive to the amount of sodium in their food, you might agree. Even so, I'd still recommend this product if you're looking for a quick, easy and tasty meal.

16/11/2021,"Kraft Velveeta-brand cheese has been around for many years. I remember having the brick of Velveeta in the refrigerator as a kid growing up. Kraft is obviously branching out, using the Velveeta name on a line of packaged food products. In the modern era, food is all about being fast, tasty, and nutritious (the latter far down on the list, sad to say). Velveeta definitely meets the first two criteria. Being chicken-based, it probably is about average for all boxed meals. The chicken is not including in the box.) This is a creamy blend of pasta, broccoli, and (added) chicken. The spices are moderate, not too hot, which is just how I like it. It's filling because of the cheese sauce and the pasta. It can fill you up quickly enough, to give a nice satiety after a moderate-sized portion. Of course the real question is, would I eat this again? If it were moderately priced, yes, I would.

The nutirition numbers are not great, but unless you're really conscious of that (like I am), they're not that bad either.

6/1/2022,I love this product very much. Taste is great! And great quality. I soak it overnight before I cook. I will order it again. Highly recommend!,1,0.7271013
16/2/2022,"I bought these for our office and they are extremely tasty. Their only drawback is price. Even with the sale I got them on, they cost nearly twice as much as the ""normal"" brands for half as much product. However, they are still quick to be bought by the staff because they taste so darn good. If they would only make 2 oz. bags for the same price! One last thought: I live in the Rocky Mountains and the shipping went over the passes in Colorado. Some of the bags lost their air and became vacuum packed as they came back down. The chips were OK, but the bags looked like they had nearly nothing in them! This is the case for many air packed and sealed items I buy East of the Rockies.",1,0.7222158
16/2/2022,"I love salt & vinegar chips and these are by far my favorite ones I've had. All my friends have enjoyed them too! The 1 ounce bags are particularly great because its a one serving size package, so you don't eat to many! I think these have a stronger vinegar flavor than many other types I've tried but its a much more pleasant one because it tastes like a good quality vinegar. Very recommended!",1,0.72695696
4/2/2022,this product was hard to find. I was thrilled to find it at Amazon. If you like figs and dark chocolate (not a candy coating) - this is the bar for you!,1,0.72127026
7/3/2022,It is hard to find this product in the store and when I do it is very expensive. This product is exactly the brand I buy but at a much better price.,1,0.72337085
1/2/2022,I ordered this along with some other sugar free stuff. This gum has a great tamales flavor. It has a waxy outside so the gum doesn't stick to other pieces etc. It is definitely spicy. I put two pieces in my mouth at once and definitely needed a beverage! Will continue to order this product,1,0.7249454

24/1/2022,Kids love to use this to make chocolate milk. It tends to be on the thick side if you are used to a Hershey's like consistency. Also wonderful on ice cream.,1,0.7272301
15/3/2022,"When the cashew butter arrived, I was pleased to note that it was made from roasted cashews, because I think roasted nut butters have more flavor. I had looked for nut butters without a lot of additives, so I was concerned to note the additon of corn oil. But then I realized that without it, the butter would have been so dense I would have had to spread it with a trowel. My first taste dispelled all concerns. Spread on a rice cake or some toast, this is going to make some late, sleepless nights almost enjoyable.",1,0.6268683

19/1/2022,"I found this in a airport and although it was priced at 2.99 which I thought was expensive, I decided to go ahead and try it. It has a very mild taste of spearmint that goes away quickly but leaves you feeling as if you have good breath. However, spearmint is not something I enjoy tasting outside of gum so I am going to try the chocolate flavor.",1,0.6157593

20/2/2022,"These are tasty and light -- but on the smallish side. They are for sure meant as a snack, not as a meal replacement. The chocolate/peanut butter combination is great, though nothing terribly different than a lot of products already out there, to tell the truth. I do like the the chocolate layer on the bottom -- it makes it seem more like a candy bar.",1,0.7269117
6/1/2022,Besides tasting great. This water has minerals that are missing in other waters and many of the foods that we consume that are grown in mineral depleted soils. You can feel the difference when you drink Destiny in how you feel hydrated. Thanks Destiny,1,0.72687143

15/1/2022,I buy this exact same product at a large oriental market here in Florida...same size package for $1.49. I think they are fantastic for making sushi summer rolls. Make sure you are rolling them tight enough and don't soak them as long as the package says...as some of the product you add will add more moisture...I actually spritz mine instead of soaking and you can always spritz a little water on them later if need be. These performed for me just as they should.,1,0.6936737

20/1/2022,"Love to mix this with my espresso and occasionally with some sparkling water. Great flavor with no aftertaste like some sugar free products. One word of advice, a little goes a long way. Don't overdue it with the pump. I have used the sugar-free French vanilla and sugar-free caramel, I find the regular vanilla to be the best.",1,0.7270336
23/2/2022,"As others have eloquently stated, this tastes great! A true vanilla flavor shines through (even though this is sugar free) As a bonus this is sold in a package of three with the option of automatic replenishment. This is a nice service for two reasons: 1) you don't have to worry about running out and not having more to add to the coffee 2) it's a little cheaper on price. It's nice to get a break once in a while!",1,0.7270516
8/3/2022,"I love to add caramel to my cappuccino in the morning and this is a great product. It doesn't take a lot of syrup to flavor, so this 3 pack is going to last a long time. I will definitely be ordering this again.",1,0.7269417

5/12/2021,"Very tasty treat for when we are on the go! Love the fact that it's instant protein in a pre-packaged, quick to grab serving size. I prefer these when they are slightly chilled but the kids seem to like even when they are at room temperature.",1,0.727155
12/12/2021,"this product is tasty, low calorie and high in protein. It is a little salty on the taste but that is probably because of the nature of being jerky.",1,0.7263005

5/12/2021,"These are so tasty! I love banana with chocolate with anything. It is a very small bag of treat. I thought I can finish the whole bag when I bought one from Whole Foods Market. But, it was very filling and a few of those was satisfying enough. Maybe 3 to 4 servings in a bag. So, it is not so bad the price wise. However, at Whole Foods, it is $4.69 a bag. Here at Amazon, a bag is $5.54. It looks like a deal with pack of 3, it is not at all a deal. It is too bad the price is not even the same as at Whole Foods. This means it is super expensive at Amanzon!! I never thought of that. It is good to compare the prices...",1,0.72603285

21/11/2021,I add this to my morning hot cereal. Couldn't be a better way to start the day. It seems a little high except that I haven't been able to find it at any local stores. So my theory is better to pay it than miss it. I've tried a lot that were less expensive but they were not as good.,1,0.6042678

21/11/2021,"I bought this in bulk and froze it, each pkg was delicious as the first. I drink a lot of coffee and I don't like STRONG, bitter coffes, like some of the boutique brands (Starbucks).

1/2/2022,"I don't know if I would eat this for breakfast because the sugar high would probably leave me twitching until lunch, but good stuff as desert or a snack. They taste much better than I thought they would, and are more than just ""reminiscent"" of a sugar cookie like many poptart flavors. Not much of a poptart fan overall, but I do dig these. I have never attempted to eat both tarts in the package though so take caution if you plan to scarf them both at the same time. I can totally see a sugar crash if somebody ate these with no ""real"" food in their system. I don't even want to imagine what a toddler or adolescent would be like on a sleeve of these suckers for breakfast.",1,0.72589207
4/2/2022,Has a deep flavorful taste w/ bright overtones. You get a heady aromatic smell as you grind the beans and it transports the earthy dark roast without the bitterness. It's a great morning coffee,1,0.72733665
17/2/2022,"Pleased, but surprised to received 6 jars of peanut butter. This is a good product, I like the taste and creamy texture, which for me is the most important. I've been a fan of another brand for many years, but after trying Planters, I may switch.",1,0.72684944

15/3/2022,"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead. This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda. I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that. As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia!",1,0.7218731

23/2/2022,"Great taste and no soy or sucrose and 20 gms of protein, it is win win. Havent got tired of using these in over 2 years. Great chocolate taste, and easy to chew and swallow, unlike some other bars. I alternate with VPX zero-impact.",1,0.7273018

19/3/2022,"This gelatin tastes NOTHING like the Knox or other varieties you can find in the grocery stores and this is a good thing since those taste like sludge for the most part, to be polite. I drink one tablespoon dissolved in hot water to make a tea, twice a day. The taste is somewhere between neutral and pleasantly rich but in an extremely subtle way. I really enjoy drinking it in my teas unsweetened, although my housemates think I'm a freak for doing it, not that me filling the freezer with animal bones and organs and bee pollen and fermenting random stuff on the counter doesn't make me a freak already. I originally bought this as a way to get more protein after reading what I now know was a quite quackery-laden blog post. Gelatin is NOT a complete protein. It's pretty much just proline and glycine, and has no tryptophan. So don't order for this purpose. However, if you're ordering to help your joints, skin, hair, cellulite, nails, etc. I think that this is the best you can buy. I've been using it to get rid of cellulite (since it runs in my family) and it's a lot easier than constantly boiling bones and less gross than drinking bone broth at 7 am in the middle of the summer. And after doing this for a few weeks, my booty/thighs are looking shaa-weet! It's pretty crazy actually; I love this stuff.",1,0.6213945

5/12/2021,"These are not only a great deal, but very delicious, too! And, they are a low-cal, guilt-free treat when you wrap them around broccoli slaw with mung bean sprouts, sesame seeds, lime juice, a little chili oil, cilantro, sugar or Splenda.... Great way to get creative and hands-on with your food! The kids loved it!! We dunk them in a little sweet chili sauce. One thing to note: I think it says to soak them in water for 30 seconds or so. Really, it only needs 5-7 seconds. It might seem like it's not soft enough yet, but take it out anyway! It continues to absorb the water and soften for the next few minutes. The wrapping technique takes a few tries to perfect, but you don't feel bad about eating your trial runs!! We ate them fresh, not fried or baked. Although, I'm sure that would be delicious, too. I bought the 3pks. There are several in each pack, and they're shelf stable. So, at this price, go for the 3pk! You'll want to wrap these babies around everything! Leftover coleslaw is what we're wrapping today!",1,0.72696483

15/3/2022,I use dried fruit when baking and cherries are my favorite. These are excellent. My only complaint would be that they contain a bit more sugar than I desire. I buy an order twice a year and find they maintain their quality well. The taste is great. The fruit stays moist and juicy. It works well for making sauces and added to salads. I will continue to order them through Amazon's subscribe and save program as I think they are a good deal.,1,0.7269077
21/12/2021,"I use this soup mix as a base for pot pie filling. I purchased it first at Costco and was sorely disappointed when they discontinued carrying it. Finally, I searched Amazon and viola! It is good even by itself on cold days, though I add spices for a pop. For my pot pies, I add a variety of things like cooked and diced chicken, veggies, white pepper, fresh minced garlic, minced onion, etc. Line little pie tins with dough from scratch, fill with prepared soup concoction, top with dough, press finger marks along the the edges and it's ready to pop in the oven or freezer for future use (from freezer, great for home cooked last minute meals). I highly recommend this soup mix.",1,0.7259838

26/3/2022,"I purchased this based on the reviews. Personally, I found it too sweet and a weird artificial vanilla flavor.

24/11/2021,"So I bought these treats for my cat, Gucci. He's 3 years old, and has carried a bit of excess weight most of his life. Even through continuing efforts to bring him to and maintain a healthier weight, he has never been much of an agile cat. He struggled just to jump onto the couch sometimes. I never thought he may have been having joint issues until my vet mentioned it. Which led me to try these. First, both of my cats LOVE the flavors. They gobble these things up no problem, which is saying a lot for Gucci who is a bit picky. As for whether or not they actually work, I am a firm believer that they do. About a week after starting these, I watched Gucci leap from the doorway of my bedroom all the way onto my bed in a single bound. He now runs up and down his cat tower as if he were a kitten again. I'm so glad I decided to purchase these. I would recommend them every time!",1,0.6560697

20/12/2021,"I've tried several coconut water brands ever since my trip to Tobago in 2010. Most of what I've found in the stores was just plain bad. Shopping at health food stores I've had more luck with brands like C2O and Blue Monkey, but this is by far the best stuff I've found. It's sweet tasting, so if that's not your thing than skip this one. Like all coconut water you have to drink this stuff cold, taste terrible warm. It baffles me, but the nutrition information on the can leads me to believe it's about twice as good for you as my second favorite brand. I'm not sure if I 100% believe it, maybe different measurement techniques or something; both have the same single ingredient: 100% young Thai coconut water. Who knows. It's also not cheap, fortunately there is prime shipping on this. I'd say overall it's a good deal considering how heavy this is to ship, so the price is justified in my mind. At a little over $2/can, it's about what you'd pay at a whole foods, etc. It's worth noting that the large cans in other brands are typically *slightly* larger than this one (maybe 17 ounces), but it's hardly worth noting that. Final analysis: if you like sweet coconut water I think this is really the best brand to go for.",0,0.71544033

18/3/2022,"I love the Pumpkin Spice K-Cup! I typically drink bold and extra bold coffees - and the Pumpkin Spice doesn't qualify as either. But it smells just like pumpkin pie....and tastes pretty close to it as well. One thing I found out though is to definitely add some kind of sweetener (whether it be artifical sweetener or sugar). I always drink coffee with just cream...and when I did so with the Pumpkin Spice, I really didn't think much of it. However, as soon as I added a packet of artificial sweetener, the pumpkin flavor just came to life and I loved it! So even if you don't typically add sweetener, try it with and without - and I'd be willing to bet that you'll like it much better with the sweetener. On a side note, do a little price shopping. Amazon typically has good prices on a number of things, but not always on K-Cups. Normal pricing is $13.95 for boxes of 22 or 24 (some kinds come in quantities of 22...others are 24). If you sign up for the ""Subscribe and Save"", you'll save 15%....so that's a good deal. But do the math on some of these other quantities - make sure you're not paying more than $13.95 for 22/24 cups. Otherwise, it's not a good deal.",1,0.7258554

I just discovered this line of products last week, when a friend brought over two of the vinaigrettes, this one I'm reviewing and the Meyer lemon vinaigrette, which has an even brighter flavor. I drizzled this on shrimp and it was just lovely. It also works well on chicken and pork and, of course, salads.

15/12/2021,"Once I got this and saw the chunks of aloe floating inside, I sort of dreaded trying it. It just seemed too weird. But I'm glad I took a chance on it because it's fabulous stuff. I'm a big fan of green tea but find most of the bottled stuff too sweet. This was right-on perfect for my tastes. Having real sugar is a huge plus. And the passion fruit flavor is notable without tasting artificial. A great flavor blend. Chantea really nailed it. The aloe pieces are small and chunky yet soft like pieces of fruit. That's probably the best analogy. They're infused with the flavor of passion fruit. They do require a bit of chewing but can easily be swallowed if it's preferred. I can understand why some people might be put off by this, but I really liked this aspect of the tea. It's wonderfully unique. If it didn't have the aloe, I would've still liked it but not enough to consider getting another. And to me, the aloe chunks really make this special. In conclusion, this tea surpassed all my expectations. If you like green tea and would like to try something truly different and fruity, get this stuff. It really is wonderful!",1,0.7204756

24/3/2022,"I am a tea lover - hot or cold - so when I saw this product, I thought I would give it a try. It has many things in it I like: green tea, passion fruit, and aloe vera. Wait...aloe vera? Yep, aloe vera in a drink. I had never heard of this plant in a drink, but I had heard of its many wonderful qualities, so I thought I would try this. The taste was great. It is very sweet, and makes a wonderful cold drink on a hot day. I love the taste of passion fruit, and that is where it gets its sweet flavor. At the same time, it is equal in calories to many other drinks on the market: 80 per serving or 120 per bottle because you know you are going to drink the whole thing right away - it is that good. It has zero fat, zero protein, only 20 carbs and only 19 sugars so it does better in this area than many other sweet drinks. The only thing that I did not care for in this drink was that it has pulp in it. Now many people like pulp in orange juice or other citrus juice drinks, but I don't, so I was not wild about the pulp in this drink, but it isn't that bad either. It's just pulp. So, overall, I liked this drink especially for the hot weather we have been having here in the southern U. S.",1,0.5329155

Beware, you can go through a package fast.",1,0.7274032
13/3/2022,These taste pretty good. A nice snack to throw in the lunchbag. Unfortunately the bags only have about a dozen pretzel sandwiches in each one. They are pretty cheap though so the small amount isn't a real problem.,1,0.72622883

25/1/2022,Bought these for my 15 month old and he LOVES them. It's nice having a savory snack as most of them tend to be on the sweeter side. He goes NUTS for them and I know it's not as empty as junk food since it has the tomato and cheese in it. The only thing is you have to use it quickly or it can go soft in the can if left for too long. It's also a bit messy so not so good for special clothes. Other than that ... OMG it tastes great!! The Veggie Dip and Mild Cheddar are also great.,1,0.7244235

The filets are large, my husband and I split one for dinner with a salad and rice - it was the perfect amount. I perfer to overcook them in the oven a bit - that way the outside gets really crunchy and actually tastes fried! All the oils come out and sizzles the breading (I added no butter or oil - just right on top of a cookie sheet sprayed with pam). The inside doesn't get dried out and you feel like you are indulging :)",1,0.7250996

The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination. These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!",1,0.72394687

6/3/2022,It's a good thing I am not allergic to nuts because this Vanilla Almond Bar is really loaded with them. There is only 4 grams of sugar so the total taste is not very sweet but it is still quite delicious. Each bar is 210 Calories but 140 of them are from fat. This is not really a problem since the fat is from nuts which is the good kind of fat. The bar is a bit dryer than most other ones I've tried so I like to have a drink on standby near me when I eat one. This appears to be a really healthy snack and tasty without making my blood sugars hit the roof. I will be buying these again and I highly recommend them.,1,0.72701734

CONS: - Could use some more white chocolate - Makes me thirsty, must have a beverage with it OVERALL: This is a pretty good flavor. The macadamia nuts help deviate from the regular nut flavors typically found in this kind of food, like peanut and almond.

While the cookies aren't as gooey as advertised (they aren't messy to eat at all), they are indeed fudge filled - break a cookie in half and all you see is fudge. In fact, there seems to be more fudge than cookie (there are chocolate chips on the cookies but I couldn't really taste them). However, the fudge taste is never overwhelming - the combination of cookie and fudge is delicious.

The berries don't have a very long shelf life, although it can be extended in the fridge or freezer. I hadn't used all the berries until a week after I received them, and by then they seemed to lose a little potency, but I only kept them in cold storage some of the time. I had these for a party, and it was a great experience. I've had miracle fruit (berries and tablets) before, and I suspect that the effect lasts longer if the surface of the tongue is disturbed less. The faster you eat things, the faster the effect seemed to wear off, so take your time and enjoy it for the upper part of the 30 minute - 2 hour range.

I don't eat these as part of a diet or anything, so I don't know if they are healthy enough to qualify for that. Most likely not though, since they do have sugar in them. However, they have a fair amount of protein and vitamins, so if you aren't looking for something especially healthy, these can make a good snack. I mainly use them as a quick meal in the mornings when I'm rushing to class, and they serve perfectly for that. However, if you're hungry, eating just one won't be enough, so they're no replacement for real food.

The flavor was good, the rice flour does give it a bit of a gritty texture but it's not much.

It has a good taste, but not the spicy taste you normally find with many Indian foods. The thing I like about most Tandoor products is that the ingredients taste fresh - I know what I am supposed to be eating and I don't have the look at the package to remind me of what is ""supposed"" to be in the package. This isn't a product I would want alone for a meal - but having it with a variety of Indian dishes makes for a very fun meal. These dosa's are individually wrapped - which means I can just eat one at a time and take them out when I am in the mood for one. There are times I will just take out one and heat it for lunch.

Each bag comes with a packet of caramel--actually it's a flat, soft piece of caramel in a foil packet. You have to put the popped corn into a microwave safe container, cut the caramel piece into four pieces, lay them over the popped corn, and put it back into the microwave until the caramel is melted.

After searching on Amazon.com I found this, and since we have a Trader Joe's in our area I decided to give it a try. Tastes just like the imported spread we bought at Big Lots, and was cheaper. I haven't tried it on anything, but I do like the taste. To me it tastes like a Graham Cracker. My wife makes sandwiches with it.

I just appreciate the value. All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity. Highly recommended.",1,0.7261075
23/2/2022,"Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for my wife and me this is the best tasting hazelnut coffee that we have ordered. It has a nice aroma, distinctive hazelnut taste that is not too weak or too strong, and a very smooth taste (not bitter at all). This is a great coffee to start your day or to enjoy with some cake or pie for dessert. When I ordered the 50 count pack, I didn't realize that the K cups came loose in a big box. That is not a convenient way for me to store them, so next time I will probably order two 24 count boxes that I can stack up in my closet along with the other K cup flavors that I have. The current price on Amazon of $29.99 is about the same as on various internet sites, but as a Prime member I don't pay shipping (as you have to do on the internet sites unless you spend a certain amount that is much more than the cost of this product), so for me it is a good deal.",1,0.7272185

21/1/2022,"Namaste mixes really are quite tasty. The texture is smooth and in general they are as good to me as a gluten eater as those made with wheat. Having such good quality mixes would help the transition to a G/F diet for those who suffer mildly from gluten sensitivity and also for their families. One thing that is inaccurate in their packaging is the meaning of the word namaste. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision June 2003, taken literally, it means ""I bow to you"". The word is derived from Sanskrit (namas): to bow, obeisance, reverential salutation, and (te): ""to you"". Some Hindus believe that this greeting recognizes the divinity in eachother, while others feel it is only a sign of deep respect. Despite the inaccuracy (""no literal translation""), the name of the food is apropos to its contents.

23/2/2022,"When I saw Ribena on Amazon I knew that the internet now has everything. Ribena is a concentrate, you must mix it with water before drinking it. I guess this saves on shipping and space since instead of buying 600ml, you're buying 5400ml (since they ask you to mix it with 8 parts water.) This type of packaging seems to have fallen out of favor since it isn't that popular anymore. What it is: It's a blackcurrant drink. Blackcurrant seems to be a berry particular to the British since no other nation sells this type of drink that I know of. On researching it, I found that it became popular in Britain during WW2 because there were few other sources of vitamin C available to British children during the war and this berry was suitable for growing in the UK climate. It's hard to describe the taste of blackcurrant to anyone who hasn't tasted it, only that it's a little like grape juice but without any tartness or aftertaste and quite sweet. I can't really compare it with anything else since it just simply taste better than any time of grape or berry juice that I've ever had. I can only say that it's great tasting and you must try it. On top of this flavorful goodness, blackcurrants are also rich in vitamins and anti-oxidants; it's almost like hamburgers which are good for you, or cigarettes which prolong your life, something too good to be true! You can drink it cooled in the fridge or hot with hot water and it tastes good both ways! When I was a kid I used to drink shots of it in a shot glass mixed with only 2-3 parts of water, ahh the memories... and the abuse my pancreas must have taken... As I see from other reviews, most Americans who love this love it for nostalgia's sake having had it as a child overseas. Well, it really is as good as nostalgia and I'm glad I can find it through Amazon today.",1,0.6810963

Also if you are one of the people who thinks the crumbs at the bottom of the box are the best part of cereal, you will be happy to learn about half of my last bowl were crumbs.",1,0.71778893

3/11/2021,Since their inception the Maxwell House International coffees have pretty much been the best coffee drinks available in their price range. The pumpkin spice is no exception. The spice flavor is hearty & bold but never overpowering the coffee itself. When mixed it has just the right amount of foam. A little whipped cream on top? Yea! It probably isn't a flavor you would want every day but with the variety of flavors Maxwell House has in their International line of coffee drinks you could go a long time without having the same drink twice. They hit another home run with this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,1,0.72233415

Although these are small in size, they dunk really well. However what sets these cookies apart is their taste. You can taste the ginger and molasses very clearly and it retains that fresh out of the kitchen flavor. In my opinion taste alone lifts this humble cookie to the heights of a mini delicacy.

It's good to add to something like tacos or burritos, and you can tell it's a Taco Bell product. It's tastes similar to the other sauces that Taco Bell commonly puts on it's products.

23/3/2022,"The color of Kirstian Reg&aacute;le Pomegrante-Apple is peach-ish, or coral. The Pomegranate is the stronger smell, overwhelming the apple. The fizz isn't nearly as fizzy as Martinelli's, and the taste is sharp with a strong bite. The Pomegranate gives it a fair amount of acidity without too much of a tang. The bite overwhelms the finish as it fizzles away. The apple can be tasted, but acts more to tone down the pomegranate. It went very well with the lemon chicken we had, which was already pretty acidic. The Chicken was pretty light, yet still strongly acidic, and this Sparkler went well with it. It's sweet, but much dryer than any of the other sparkling juices we've had, and cleanses the palette much like the dealcoholized wines I've had. Less of a soda than other sparkling juices I've tried so far, with smaller bubbles. It's not flat, just finer. This doesn't have a head, while the others generally have a bit of one. This one also has continues tiny bubbles drifting upwards, where the others I've tried so far (Welch's Red and their White sparkling juices, as well as R.W. Knudsen's Sparkling Pear Juice and Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Grape) just have bubbles that are stagnant, attached to the side of the glass (in general.)

19/12/2021,"I've tried what seems like every brand of flavored water out there. I was in the convenience store today and this caught my eye. I also noticed the zero calories so I decided to give it a shot. The first thing I noticed was the smell when I opened the bottle. It smelled delicious. Most flavored waters are hit and miss especially when it comes to kiwi/strawberry. Another thing I really miss with flavored water is the carbonation. This is mildly carbonated and the taste is almost perfect. It could be a little more tart and less sweet but it's almost perfect. At least it doesn't have that medicinal, insect repellent flavor some other drinks have. I can't wait to try the other flavors. Zero calories. Tastes and smells great. Recommended.",1,0.5626208
8/3/2022,"This is a great price for what seems like a high-quality, natural dog chew. These last longer for my GSD than more expensive bully sticks, so I appreciate the good alternative.

I think the alfalfa tastes better than store bought by far! It is organic and no worries of something ""icky"" being on them like in the store. I also got this kit quickly and well packed.

15/12/2021,"My husband and I have raised honey bees for years, though we cannot call our honey organic because we live in an area where other farmers use chemicals which our bees may bring home to the hive unintentionally. This honey is the most delicious honey I have ever tasted!! We did have one time when we raised bees in Southern Illinois in a large clover field that was close to this good, maybe even as good though flavor somewhat different. YS Royal Honey is so good it was hard to not eat too much. We should all practice temperance in eating, even if it is something that is ""good for you."" Although the price is high, consider it like gourmet candy. Because it is not heated to high temperatures in processing, it crystallizes much quicker than more refined honey products. But, it can easily be liquefied by placing the jar in a pan of hot water (not on the stove). If you put it in the microwave to soften it, you will kill some of the beneficial elements in the honey. Microwave ovens are great for heating water, but must be used at low power levels for short periods of time if you want to maintain the beneficial micro-nutrients in your food! Also, research has shown that if you use plastic containers in the microwave, chemicals are released from the plastic which are then absorbed by the food. The chemicals accumulate in your body and can eventually lead to cancer. Use glass or ceramic only in the microwave because they do not release any harmful chemicals when used in the microwave!!!!",1,0.711766

13/3/2022,"My daughter is 5 months old and has been struggling since the day she was born with constipation, gas, and reflux. We've tried formula after formula after formula, nothing but vomit and severe constipation. Finally we found a formula that helped with her constipation but she was still having problems with her reflux, even with added rice. The drs however continued to say she was at a steady growing rate so there was nothing to worry about. Well, one day I ran out of formula and ran to the store to pick up some more. FORTUNATELY, the store was out of the Similac Alimentum. Nearing her feeding time, I was in a rush, so I glanced over the other formulas to find one that would be the closest match. I just happened to pick up Similac Sensitive R.S. Now not only is she not spitting up, she's staying full longer, sleeping through the whole night, and SHE'S NOT GASSY OR CONSTIPATED!!! HURRAY! Another minor pro is that it doesn't reek like the Alimentum does. Kind of smells like Vanilla Flavored Ensure.

My sister and I keep one in our purses and one by our coffee makers. We still love them and I'm ordering another 6pk of the .75 oz today because it appears to be the best value.",1,0.6975874

17/3/2022,"This stuff is wonderful! I'm a huge fan of herbal tea but have never bought this brand before because it is so expensive. I decided to give it a try after constantly seeing it get good reviews in health magazines and as it is becoming more available in more stores. I ordered two kinds, and LOVED THEM. I've tried 4 other kinds just this week. They truly do SAY what they are going to do. This one truly is so relaxing. I also recommend the Get Clean, Get Gorgeous and Get ZZZ's.

I was afraid I had just thrown money out the window. But when I got my order I cracked open the bag & these were fantastic! They were slightly sweet, chewy & ""fresh"" in a freeze dried way. I will definitely buy from Navitas Naturals brand again!",1,0.61255366
15/2/2022,"I love flavored stevia, and this is one of my favorites! Also, Stevita is an awesome brand. I buy their product line regularly and am very pleased. This product tastes very good to me with a medium degree chocolate flavor. I mix it with my protein shakes to turn a vanilla into chocolate, or make a chocolate more chocolaty (I'm a chocolate lover). What I love about this product is that it is tasty, low in calories (13 calories for two teaspoons I believe), and sweetened with all natural stevia. I make it a point to never consume anything with harmful, poisonous chemicals such as sucralose or aspartame, so the fact that this is sweetened with stevia is extremely important. The container does not come with a spoon or scooper, so be certain you have a measuring teaspoon to use with it if you are counting calories and need to be exact. Inside the container, it looks and feels similar to cocoa. Taste is personal and particular, but I do so enjoy this and recommend it. I hope you like it too!",1,0.7275187

4/3/2022,"My fiancee and I have been testing out alternatives to regular milk. I like regular milk, but she does not (though this wasn't the only considered factor). We both enjoy soy milk and Whole Foods 365 almond milk. So we figured we would also like the Dream brand as well since we had a coupon. Regrettably, the Almond Dream milk is the worst milk I have ever tasted. Even regular milk that has gone a little off doesn't bother me, and milk that has certainly gone off still isn't this bad. I'm not a picky milk person. We are pouring the rest of this milk down the drain. I will consider the possibility that the milk we purchased is bad, in which case there is a quality control issue for what is a very expensive product. I'll pass on this brand in the future.",1,0.6048066

However I highly recommend Meiji Chocorooms, 3.13-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10) over these. Chocorooms are extremely similar to these except their crispier and have a higher chocolate to cookie ratio, I much prefer them.",1,0.72675306
27/12/2021,"One of the reasons people hate being healthy or trying to be fit is because of flavor. The old saying ""If it tastes good, spit it out"" referring to diets is how a lot of people view it. This beverage won't help this thought. I have tried at least three of the Skinny girl alcohols, the most recent being the white peach margarita which sounded good in theory. The flavor is horrible....barely drinkable at best. You'll only finish it out of desperation not to waste your money. It smells like peaches and tastes like super bitter grapefruits. There are plenty of other options to turn to if you don't want to stray from your fit lifestyle and still have some flavor or enjoy a cocktail once in a while. I'm confused why these products are still being sold....must be the celebrity attachment. Bethenny probably doesn't drink her own products.",0,0.5480894

9/3/2022,"I tried this on a pizza and in spaghetti. It tastes really great! The flavor of the three cheeses is so different from just plain parmasean. The price is a little high but worth it since I cannot get this where I live. If you want a change from parmasean, give this a try.",1,0.72730905

It is also a strong wine when done, I put 750 ml bottle of grain alcohol in my batch then it was even better,like a good nightcap. Yes it does get 30 375ml bottles from the batch but, I used blue bottles and a nice lable and gave them for the holiday season and they were a big hit. For the price I do not think you can beat this kit",1,0.72518015

Paired with a sugar free peanut butter on light bread - this is the perfect snack or small lunch. The splenda taste is apparent but not overbearing.

15/2/2022,"I tasted this before feeding it to my nephew. It tastes just like you would expect apple sauce to taste if it were made with pears. PROS - Delicious - my nephew loved it, both plain and mixed in with his baby oatmeal - The cap was easy to twist off - It's easy to dispense. No scraping around inside with a spoon. You can squeeze it all out really easily - Organic, no GMO, no pesticides, etc etc CONS - It really is bulkier than a little jar of stage 1 food. Those can be stacked and they really just don't take up as much room. You could fit 20 jars in a cupboard in the same space where you could fit maybe 8-10 of these - The box mine came in was sticky because one of the bags inside was leaking and had to be tossed. That's probably not typical, but it did happen to me and is worth noting. OTHER FACTS - Kosher. OU Certified on the box and individual packages - Vegan certified, with the V symbol on the box and individual packages - The package is 4.5 ounces, which is supposedly 2 servings (according to Baby Gourmet) but it's not. (For reference, a jar of stage 1 baby food is generally 4 ounces. So it's just slightly larger.) Overall, I think this is a very good product.",1,0.7261945
25/3/2022,"The product was great. Amazon's ability to watch expiration dates leaves a lot to be desired. Pros: Tasty Greens! AWESOME packaging - this is by far the easiest to use pouch baby food I've tried. The spout in the corner just makes it so much easier to dispense by the spoonful. It stands up nicely. Cons: - Expensive. - I was also shipped (by Amazon) baby food that was 1+ month expired. (7/13/12) - AND it was clearly a return. (My shipping box contained a box with a return label TO Amazon and then that contained the baby food.) I used 2 of the pouches before I realized it was expired. (I smell and/or taste all her new food and it didn't taste unfresh or bad.) Expiration dates are usually overly cautious, especially with baby products, so I've continued to use the pouches but will probably not go past the 2 month expired mark. I guess the expiration date explains why they were free in the Vine program. If I'd paid for these, you can bet I'd be livid with Amazon.",1,0.72694516
9/3/2022,"I have 6 month old twin grandsons who have just started on solids. They aren't real sure they like to eat, yet. We tried the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens out on them. I was anticipating funny faces and it coming out on the chin since children do not usually like greens. As Dr. Oz has said, vegetables are bitter and things in the wild that are poisonous are bitter, so rejecting bitter things is a safety thing ingrained in our DNA. Much to our surprise, they really liked it. It's nice to have vegetables they really like. The pouches are new to us. You can heat the food by placing the pouch in hot water, or you can transfer it to a bowl and use the microwave, being careful to check for hot spots. Room temp was fine for our guys. The package says it contains 2 servings, so that is perfect for our two guys.",1,0.5518554
3/3/2022,"I like it and I think my baby will too! (not born yet) As a soon to be parent, I'm not sure how this will come into play but I'm sure I'll find out. I believe the packaging said to prepare it how you like it, or your baby, (hot or cold), then pour it out. I would think your baby can hold this and slurp it out, of course I think they'll have to be old enough. I'm sure newborns can't. That said, it will be an adventure if I'm so totally wrong and the food gets squirted out all over the place right? ;) Taste great and is organic for those of us on the lookout for it, but of course, organic can sometimes mean pricey and it is somewhat here, but well worth it in the end.",1,0.72145677
12/3/2022,"Firstly I should mention that I only tested one bottle of this water, so as for long-term benefits of the 9.5 pH I can't really comment, but as for taste I can safely say it is a refreshing bottle of water. And I should also mention that I'm pretty picky about my water. Not all of it is created equal, that's for sure. Essentia certainly passes my Yum scale and feels plenty hydrating--although no more than my usual bottle of water, as far as I can tell. I like the 1.5 liter size because I like to keep a bottle of water handy pretty much all times, but do be aware that it's pretty big so if that's not what you want... keep it in mind. Overall, great tate, affordable price, maybe long-term benefits due to the bonus electrolytes and balanced pH. A great choice, IMO, but I wouldn't really consider it any more fantastic than other bottled water.",1,0.7196831
30/3/2022,"Used chicken rather than beef [saving of around 3g of fat per serving]. It was tasty but I do think that the beef would have enhanced the meal more. Very easy to prepare. Cooked the dish on high for 5 hours, left it to warm for 30 mins and then cooked it on low again for 30 mins. Beans were just about done; they were still a little bit crunchy which mightn't be to everyone's taste. I'd make this again.",1,0.7242872

Really wonderful!) They come with a little fork, which makes them easy to remove from the jar, and I have several forks now. What do you do with them after a while?

This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.

27/11/2021,"Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish. Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life. Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years). A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh. They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using. The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor. It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor. Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned. The Porcinis have a more bold earthy taste. They go very well in soup, stews and pasta sauce (be sure to add the hydrating water to the pasta sauce, yummy!). The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend.",1,0.7218818

I can barely taste the vinegar, which is great as I'm not a fan of the very vinegary, Louisiana-style sauces. Just pure habanero flavor; bright citrusy tones, and long-lasting but not overwhelming heat. It's not a use-on-everything sauce, but for dishes that go well with that distinctive fruity habanero taste... yum. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's a very thick sauce, more of a puree, really, and the bottles have narrow mouths. It doesn't pour well at all.

I made it on my Villaware Belgian wafflemaker on setting 6, using 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup oil (recipe calls for 1/4 oil), and it came out dark-brown and crispy on outside and very moist on the inside - just delicious. Using two cups of the mix, I got about 5 waffles. I've also purchased the Carbon's Golden Malted waffle mix, which I've like, but I prefer Robby's because it's so much more flavorful - perhaps I should try buttermilk with the Golden Malted as well. The downside is Robby's calls for 1/4 cup of oil, while Golden Malted requires 2 tbs of butter - so if you're looking for something lower fat, you may want to look at the Golden Malted. By the way, I was surprised to see that the folks who make Carbon's Golden Malted make the Robby's mix as well.

I put a little in my coffee this morning, to see if i could replicate a starbucks-ish drink...I had seen where others had said something about the taste being similar...and let me tell you what....it is AWESOME! the only thing i did not care for was the small packaging...i thought i was getting a bigger product, but that in fact is my fault because i did not pay attention to the ounces in the description. anywho, I would recommend this item to anyone...it's a great product and a great economical solution to a $5-$7 cup of coffee from starbucks.",1,0.6574203
4/2/2022,"This tea is really tasty. I've tried myriad brands of peppermint tea and I have to say that this is a real competitor. If you've ever had peppermint tea where the peppermint wasn't evident, you'll appreciate this tea. It has menthol in it and perhaps that's the reason that the flavor is so much more robust but it was really good and it didn't leave you guessing what kind of tea you were drinking when you started out. This may be a one-off but when I sniffed it, it did noticeably clear up my sinuses for several hours afterwards. It's also caffeine-free so it's safe to have before bed. I would definitely purchase it in the future.",1,0.7268719

16/2/2022,"I was a long time French Press user but got tired of getting rid of the grounds each time. Before that, I was an early adopter of the Flavia system but it never got off the ground with us. It was such a PITA to get coffee for it. Only way to get those was online. Keurig is everywhere. Grocery stores, Bed Bath Beyond, Amazon and of course, Keurig itself. I also had some reservations because I like good, strong coffee. I don't believe in flavored water. Coffee should be coffee! The coffee itself is a separate thing but I can say I found several k-cups that fit the bill and then some. Anyway, I did my due diligence and read the reviews of the Keurig coffee makers and found that many of the higher end ones had some issues. I didn't want to deal with issues. I just want to be able to pop in the k-cup and press the button and drink. This particular model seemed to get high ratings so I went down to my local S store and purchased it. I also went to the grocery store and picked up some K-cups. The water I use is filtered through a water softener first then it goes through a 6 stage reverse osmosis system. I don't think I will have a lot of problems with hard water! After using this machine for 2 months, it's been running like a champ. I fill the reservoir with fresh water the night before and we do about 4 or so K-cups a day. It is a bit noisy but nothing terrible. The water only takes a couple of minutes to heat up so it's quick. So for now, I give it 5 stars. If something changes, I will evaluate accordingly.",1,0.70190716

19/3/2022,"For those who favor brown rice over white, this is not a bad choice at all. Maybe the price could be a deterrent but the flavor and quality of the rice make for a tasty serving of brown rice. I like it a lot and will always stay at the back of my mind for when and if the need should arise. Better than the varieties found in supermarkets, probably more carefully processed, it satisfies with quality and taste. I usually prepare two cups at a time and before you even know it there is no more in the see through jar. I have elevated my game regarding the preparation of brown rice, for the right or should I say precise amount of water makes a significant impact on the final result. Goes well with just about anything any rice goes well with. It has been more than a decade since I have been using brown rice instead of white and there is no comparison. Of course I do eat out in some chinese restaurants and it is rare they will offer brown rice so those times I go with the flow. There is one great national chain that serves brown or white with their food and I find that awesome (Styx?). 4.5 for RiceSelect Long Grain Texmati Brown Rice, 36-Ounce Jars (Pack of 4)!",1,0.7270905

I prefer to use a mixture of equal parts real sweet cream butter and extra virgin olive oil when starting the dish with onions and then the rice followed by the addition of room temp (or warmer) brut Champagne before adding the heated broth a cup at a time. Additionally, sauteed mushrooms added into the dish at the end along with some crumbled crisp bacon and plenty of fresh grated parmesan cheese,then topped with dried parsley will make this a very satisfying meal with a fresh green salad and some crusty sourdough bread.",1,0.6720139

I switched to a Sprout fruit, and she couldn't get it down fast enough. So...there is a taste difference. I ordered cases of all and the expiration dates ranged from 1 year to 1 month from date I received them which was quite annoying.

Caffeine doesn't impact me at all so I am not a good benchmark for that. I didn't like having yoga promoted on the box because of the religious connections, but that wouldn't prevent me from purchasing it again. It has been a nice cup of tea on a cold winter day.

I have a great deal of very long, very fine, very straight hair, and generally I find that conditioners leave my hair feeling not conditioned enough (and sadly dry and static-y, particularly since I moved to the desert) or far too weighed down by product. This conditioner did neither -- it just left my hair feeling thick and shiny and smooth. I haven't been using it long enough to see if it really reduces split ends -- I brush carefully, so I'm not particularly prone to them anyway -- but it's worth the price even if that particular claim is bunk, because my hair has never in my life felt this healthy before.",1,0.70695025

4/1/2022,"Ok, i'm not really sure about that one. In January I adopted my very first cat. I haven't had one since I was 10! This is mainly due to living in apartments and allergies. My cat is a 2 1/2 year old Maine Coon. It's REALLY fat and weighs about 14lbs. He has a belly that hangs down to the floor almost. After hearing about all those bad pet foods a few years back, I did some research into what pet foods were the best. Decided to try this. I'll admit that it's NOT cheap at all, but it doesn't bother me. Why? It costs me the amazon price, but one bag can last me months! I did some research into weight loss for cats and tried to feed him the correct amount, but unfortunately after nearly a year, he hasn't lost any weight on this food. I think he just doesn't get enough exercise. He does have a ton of energy and is always running around it seems, but he still likes to sleep a LOT. Due to this food (i'd imagine) his fur is shiny and soft. Other than the weight problem he seems like a healthy cat. Sadly, I had to switch pet foods. This might sound really silly and gross to admit, but this food makes his poo extremely stinky! It stinks up the entire house when he ""goes"". No cat litter on earth will stop it. I've tried different litters and boxes, not even thinking it was the food. It most definitely was. I clear the litter box every single day, but being ""bombed out"" is not fun. Somedays it really made me ALMOST not want a cat! I switched to Wellness Healthy Weight Cat Food (which seems even more expensive) and the problem went away. I also did a taste test on my cat. I sat out a bowl of EVO and Wellness Cat foods and he preferred the wellness brand. He actually told me this. Seriously though, he would eat the Wellness, take a few bites of the EVO and then leave it alone. This doesn't really mean anything. The best tasting cat food is not always the best for a cat. The EVO food is probably of a higher quality, but i'm not sure. I'd imagine either brand is good.",0,0.56731385

5/1/2022,"There is not much more to say. There's a nice balance; not too much sugar, but enough to enjoy. The flavor is surprising, in that usually something that carries this many healthy items generally will need to be forced down. I only got to the bottom of the fourth box, as my seventeen year old seems to enjoy it as well. That being said, I'm not sure if there were not enough nuts/pecans, or that they all fell into his bowls. I hope the price doesn't go up. There was one other cereal we kept religiously with maple and pecans from a health food store, but the price shot up to four and five dollars, plus, so we stopped buying that one. Thanks Nature's Path.",1,0.7258355

Sunbutter works great for sandwiches, dipping apples, and also for baking--although when I bake with it, the muffins do turn out to be a greenish color. It doesn't affect the taste, though! This product is completely peanut-free and made in a peanut-free facility. Thanks for thinking of families with allergies!",1,0.6936522

I received a sample pack of this Nescafe Taster's Choice brand coffee from the company by mail. I am actually surprised how good it is. I didn't think that I would like the whole freeze-dried coffee thing, because I too discriminated against this type of coffee. Have always been a ground-fresh-cofee-bean person. Well, just opened the packet and tasted the Nescafe Taster's Choice VANILLA flavored packet. IT's GOOD! My daughter liked it too and now she is mixing the HAZLENUT w/hot water as I type this out.

Obviously, the strength of the flavor begins to wane after a while, but the mint part lasted until I was tired of chewing.

They are higher in fat due to the amount of nuts, but much lower in sugars than the average bar which is one reason they tasted better to me. Though they are crunchy I didn't find them too hard as one reviewer found. (I'm almost 60 and don't have that good of teeth). Now that I looked at the Amazon reviews I'm disappointed they're made in china so I will have to rethink whether to buy these again.",1,0.6892701

15/2/2022,"This is my first experience with this particular brand of curry. My wife is the usual cook in the household, but she sprained her ankle pretty badly so I was given dinner duties last night. Turned out to be the perfect time to try this out. I have to say it is extremely flavorful and bursting with curry goodness. I was impressed, as was my wife. The kids even ate it, and they aren't huge fans of curry. The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is because I can find similar very good curry at my local supermarket and save a few bucks in the process. It's certainly better or as good as most, but not so much better that I can justify the extra cost. When you have a family of four to feed on a limited budget, this is a luxury item. Good as a treat every now and then, but not as a regular purchase.",1,0.69707423
28/12/2021,"I followed the directions of this package, except I add a lot of sliced carrots in it w/ 2 lbs of really good beef sliced the recommended width. While the taste was really good, the meat was too tough for me to eat because of the width of the cut. If I had to do it again, I would not use beef and use it w/ chicken instead because the coconut wasn't able to soften the meat enough. Originally, I was expecting the final outcome to be a bit drier and more like a stir fry like the picture on the package, however it does leave a good amount of sauce that gives you the option of adding more ingredients like vegatables into the mix. For something that requires not much prep work, it's an excellent method of cooking if you don't want the hassle of finding all the spices and ingredients involved in making a curry. This is exactly the type of product I would take w/ me on a trip like camping or somewhere I wouldn't have my regular pantry available. It's absolutely simple to use and cook. It's also not very spicey, so it if you perfer more spice I'd recommend adding that. As a quick option to cooking, I'd highly recommend this production.",0,0.70636296
4/3/2022,"This is my first venture into trying Prima Taste Rendang Curry. Pros Very easy to prepare Instructions were simple Sauce was very good Only need to add water and beef Cons Although the flavor was wonderful, I had more than my share of leaves (?)/spice chunks in my portion as did my dinner partner. The coconut powder was a bit lumpy, but I see another reviewer suggested mixing coconut powder and water first and whisk in the paste. Probably a good idea. I did cook my beef until almost done (rather than to medium done as the directions suggest)and then added to the sauce because the sauce thickens very quickly. All in all, I thought this was easy and good.",1,0.726077
1/1/2022,"I found this curry sauce kit to be really tasty and able to create a large amount of sauce from one kit. Instead of using the recommended beef I used oven roasted chicken thighs and about 3 lbs of sauteed vegetables. My veggie mix consisted of yellow onion, cauliflower, broccoli, pasilla chile peppers, and jalepeno peppers. All cut into 1"" - 1.5"" pieces except for the chiles which were sliced into 0.25"" rings. I roasted the chicken and removed the skin. I then sauteed the veggies in a large wok with some olive oil. Once the veggies were near done I added the large bag of Rendang curry sauce, the packet of dried coconut milk powder, and a cup of water. The sauce mixed with the ingredients well and when all the veggies were thoroughly coated I added the chicken thighs and gently mixed to coated them as well. Although I did not have rice on my plates there would have been enough sauce to drizzle on the rice without the sauce being watery. A pasta would have worked well in place of rice. The sauce came out very flavorful without overwhelming the the vegetables or chicken. The coconut powder -- of which I had some reservations -- added a rich coconut flavor without any chemical or chalkiness. This curry sauce kit made a delicious curry stir-fry dinner last night that was good enough to have again for lunch today. I would certainly buy this curry kit in the future.",1,0.72036904
27/12/2021,"I very much enjoyed this entree kit. I love all sorts of Asian cuisine, but never tend to have the staples of cooking it in my kitchen. Because I'm on a budget, it never seems worth buying a whole pantry full of ingredients for one meal. (Of course, I aspire to gather those ingredients.) I found this mix to be a perfect way to prepare my own curry at home without buying all the specialty ingredients. I found the instructions easy to follow, and the meal easy to prepare. Until I get the Asian pantry going in my own home, I'll be looking to this brand to satisfy a craving.",1,0.722477
15/2/2022,"I confess that I didn't use the recipe on the box, I threw it into a crockpot with some chicken and other stuff. Turned out great though--not too spicy, not a thick, starch-like consistency, and it stuck to the food instead of draining off of it, into a pool on the plate.",1,0.6303614
9/3/2022,Felt a bit like I was making a special Hamburger Helper especially when I added the powdered coconut mix. Besides that this was very good. Really enjoyed this over some brown rice. Lots of yummy sauce. Has just a slight touch of spiciness that kept my young kids (3 & 5) from eating a full serving but they did like it and had a few bites. I do think a much of the taste of the dish overall will depend on the type of beef used and how you cook it. Certainly don't want to have meat be too chewy.

But for a low calories snack they are quite good, are not too hard or soft, and have a satisfying taste. Shop for price.

So we went ahead and bought two. Now our dog has one in the car and one at home, and she chews on them WHENEVER she has a chance, and there is barely any damage. They don't splinter, and they are MUCH better than Nylabones, because after our dog chews on a Nylabone for 2 hours, its shredded, but with antlers she needs to put some effort in.

6/12/2021,These Dark Chocolate Cherry Chewy Granola bars are very tasty. My family had come for a visit and these were among their travel snacks. I had not seen them in my local area before and started searching but failed in finding them. I was very pleased that Amazon had them listed and when the price became comparative to the grocery store I treated myself to a wholesome and delicious snack.,1,0.7262041
5/1/2022,"This tea is making it's rounds with my group of friends. I tried it at a baby shower and soon the mom-to-be and I had were drinking it. It's got a great flavor. Often flavored teas have an odd taste. Fake, maybe waxy, definitely not natural. Not Ahmad Tea. It smells great, tastes great. It tastes like black tea with a hint of vanilla. To me, vanilla is not a strong flavor, more of a strong smell so I love that I smell the vanilla strongly but taste it subtly. I'm typically a loose-leaf tea drinker, and tea is my caffeinated beverage of choice, so a bagged tea has to be pretty special for me to buy it. I think this tea is. I look forward to trying some more Ahmad Tea flavors.",1,0.7272309
8/2/2022,"These are great. I can't find them in the store lately, so I ordered online. Same great taste that I remember. I'm a big fan of the teriaki flavor, but I can't find those anymore.

2/12/2021,"We have tried several brands of coffee pads, even the local store brands in The Netherlands, but only one has the right taste and that is Douwe Egberts Senseo pads. We prefer medium. Delightful cup of coffee. Neighbors make excuses to knock on the door, because they know we invite them in for a Dutch coffee. In comparison with prices, they are quite a lot cheaper in Europe. So we brought an extra suitcase loaded with 2000 Senseo pads back home.

8/2/2022,"This is my favorite of the Senseo pods I have tried. It is only 10% Kona so I didn't expect it to taste as good as the 100% Kona or Kona peaberry I'd bought from coffee growers in Hawaii. I was surprised, though, because it was fuller and richer than I had expected. It's my new go-to pod coffee. :)",1,0.7237684

My husband didn't like it because the nuts were soggy to him and it was way too gooey making it difficult to peel the wrap off w/o sticky fingers. On the other hand, most of my elder relatives really enjoyed the flavor. It wasn't too sweet and had a nice soft crunch to it. For myself, I am not a fan of raisins, but it didn't deter me from enjoying the product. I really liked the fact that it wasn't sweet and tasted very natural.",0,0.7136188

12/2/2022,"I have been buying and using both the Comstock ""no sugar added"" cherry and apple pie filling for years and we all love it. My whole family is eating healthier nowadays and it makes a perfect ""light"" dessert. It has just the right amount of sweetness and just 30 or 35 calories for a decent size serving. I use it in my home-made pies because I can't make the pie filling from scratch any lower calorie than Comstock does! And I love the consistency of the product. I also use it alone, warmed up in the microwave with warm vanilla sauce that I make. A great quick dessert. Unfortunately, both supermarkets in my area have stopped carrying it!!! I was so pleased to find that Amazon did have it! It's a little more expensive than it was in the stores, but I can deal with that as long as I won't disappoint my family by not making pies anymore. :)",1,0.72719926

Wow, they were way better than I expected. I'm not a trail mix type of guy so they didn't sound that great, but next week at the office I was browsing the snack machine and saw them in there, so I gave them a sober shot and they were as good as I remembered, but they were like $1.25 a bag.

24/2/2022,I bought just one of these little bars at my local health food store and fell head over heels in love. I'm a huge coconut fan and these really hit the spot!

I use them to store rice as the bottle is air tight and keeps rice very dry, I order the 2 pack. I like that. They use sea salt so they are not overly salted. I only give it a 4 because some of the nuts are harder to open, Some are open shells and empty but I find the shelled nuts still in the bottom.

I married a good German(-American)girl and we were stationed in Germany (Bavaria) for four years, so I've acquired the taste. The mix isn't quite as good as the Gastehaus staple, but the dumplings are pretty darn close. If you try them on your redneck dinner guests without warning, however, you're liable to get a 1-Star reaction. They are heavy and gummy. With Sauerbraten und Rotkohl, that's what makes them great.",1,0.68473285

Much smaller, with very tart skins, but delicious insides. These gummy candies taste and smell exactly like the inside of those grapes. When I first opened the bag in the car, the scent filled the air and I immediately succumbed to redintegration. Even absent your own childhood memories though, I still highly recommend these. Very tasty and not too, too sweet. - mike",1,0.726796

29/1/2022,"In the great trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately. All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well. I love all 3 drinks. But if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add.",1,0.7244653

16/2/2022,I've been using Annie Chun's for years now. I like to add a bit of fresh vegtables or sometimes meat to them but they are good plain if you're in a hurry. This is very hot. Like I do with their other dishes I just dumped in the entire flavor pack...oops it was so hot I couldnt taste anything but the hot. After a bit of experimentation I found for me that about 1/2 the flavor packet and a heaping tablespoon of yogurt made this a really flavorful hot and sour dish. Add some shrimp if you can find good wild shrimp and you'll think you're in a high quality restaurant.

They are a little delicate but still hold up under a gentle spread of hummus. This variety is flavored with sun dried tomato and oregano, but I honestly did not pick up on those flavors.

This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda. I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.

I am glad I stumbled upon this at Amazon and decided to give it a try (the price was right!): it tastes just like homemade and can be whipped up in no time at all! All you need is 2 eggs, some water and oil (to fry). Having had less than pleasant experience with boxed potato pancake mixes before I was a little skeptical (and the boxes looked so small!), but Manischewitz potato pancake mix exceeded my expectations. One box was enough to feed our family of five (two adults and three kids) as a main dish (would definitely feed more people if served as a side or an appetizer). The flavor and amount of salt was just right, and we were able to get the desired textures: I love mine superthin - almost lacy - and crispy, while my husband likes his on a thicker/softer side, both turned out wonderful and absolutely delicious!

Like Frosted Flakes, it gets soggy fast in milk, so I tried to pour small bowls (and go back for more if I wanted it). We have continued to purchase this product, and it generally gets eaten right away. I guess that's a good thing, but it's pretty sweet, so it may not be the ""healthiest"" choice out there. Check the nutrition info and judge for yourself, I guess. Overall, I recommend you give it a try, if you like Frosted Flakes, or nutty cereals, or just enjoy trying something new.

15/3/2022,"It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep. Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink. In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks is the most malty, Milo is the medium chocolatey and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolatey. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick. As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk. But to those who love and grew up on Horlicks, it's just a great comfort drink. This is supposed to be 2lbs worth of Horlicks, so just make sure you like it before you buy this one!",1,0.7029386

5/12/2021,"Mango peach Mio does taste like peach. I didn't notice the mango flavor, but the peach taste was there. The concept of Mio is great, it's a concentrated flavor that you can squirt in your water and make it taste more like a tea or fruit drink. It is sugar free and low calorie and packed full of flavor. In fact, getting your water flavored perfectly is the tricky part. Too much and it's too sweet, not enough and the flavor isn't very strong. But, I guess that is the fun part. The liquid mixes instantly and can add flavor, when you want something more than plain water. I knew someone who supposedly didn't like the taste of water, so something like this would be great for her. The negative side of the Mio is that it is full of chemicals, dyes, and fake sugars. Even though the amount ingested is minute, as far as health goes, this probably isn't good for you. Although, dieters may like it because it is low cal flavor.",1,0.7243955
21/11/2021,"Mio Mango Peach Water Flavor comes in a handy small package that lets you instantly add sugar-free, calorie-free flavor to any water. You can use it at the gym, at work, in a restaurant, you name it. The small plastic container - about the size of a deck of cards - has a snap-tight lid and holds 24 servings of flavoring. To add flavor to water you simply open up the lid, squirt in the flavoring, and stir or shake the water. The liquid quickly dissolves /spreads throughout the water and gives it a flavor. The mango peach flavor is light and gentle - certainly more like drinking a punch of this flavor than a freshly pureed combination of those two fruits. But you can't fault it too much for that. It's not cloyingly sweet, and since you are the one mixing it up, you can make the flavor as strong or light as you wish. This is one of the unit's weaknesses, though. You have in essence a squeeze-toy and are squeezing it manually with your hand to get liquid to come out. This is far from an exact science. There's no fine line between a teaspoon and a tablespoon. You need to squirt less and then add a little more if you need to. There's no way, of course, to unsquirt the flavoring once it's in the water. The most you could do is add more water. Still, I have to say I think this is fairly brilliant. In the past there were powder options to carry with you that were messy and hard to use. You'd spill the powder. You'd have trouble getting the powder to really mix into the liquid. With this liquid flavoring option, it's so much simpler. The unit squirts without dripping. The liquid blends into the water pretty much instantly. It carries easily in your purse and with its 24-serving ability it means if a friend or two want some as well you can share. For nutrition, there's no calories, no fat, no sodium, no carbs, no protein, no nothing. It adds flavor to your water and nothing else. This is a great way to get you to drink more water, which is important for your health! The sweeteners used here are sucralose and acesulfame potassium. The amounts are so tiny (under 2%) that I really wouldn't worry about that and, again, if you're currently not drinking enough water and this will help you do that, then I'm all in favor of that. Well recommended!",1,0.72572166
15/3/2022,"I drink a lot of water. In the summer I drink a lot of fizzy water -- I even have my own water fizzer -- and sometimes I want it to have some flavor. Not sugar, I don't want soda, just a little something to break up the monotony of water, water and water, with water on the side. I've tried a couple of flavoring products and remained unimpressed, but I have to say that MiO surprised me. The flavor is really clean and natural, and the sweetness, though from artificial sources, (Sucralose) isn't off-putting. I'd prefer it unsweetened but it's not horrible; I'm fine with it. I've tried it in water and in hot and cold tea, and in each case, MiO enhanced the beverage. It's easy to use and each bottle looks to have a fairly generous amount of flavoring in it. (At least it does for me; I use one squirt for anything up to a liter of liquid. At this price point, MiO is a very good alternative to soda, in my opinion. There are a lot of different flavors, so if mango-peach doesn't suit, you have other choices. I liked this one so much I'm tempted to try some of the others. How much more of a recommendation could you ask for?",1,0.6856466
21/12/2021,"While the idea of add as much as you like or as little as you like seems like a good idea, there is a chance that you will not get the recommended servings from ANY of the MIO products. I usually 2 - 3 squirts in a 20oz water bottle to get a flavor that doesn't taste watered down. The flavor of the product is great, but take caution when adding more as it tends to become bitter and not more intense. The price of these are somewhat expensive compared to the single serve powders out there on the market, which usually I do have an issue with the taste. I personally can by Mio at the grocery store on sale cheaper. If the price was to come down on these they would be a serious swap out for the powder water enhancers.",0,0.65389645

Using only this product as a sugar substitute and limiting sugar & carb's from other products and without excercise I was able to lose 18 lbs.

These are not lunches for the large appetite or those on salt-restricted diets. But they are better than edible, very portable, shelf-stable and with some neat diverse flavors.

It is now my new favorite. It's not at all strong. It has just the right amount of essence. It's terrific for a refreshing drink.

It has a nice and spicy taste. It has a little heat but in a good way. I plan to buy some more soon and this will be what I get. I try to keep some stocked up. Most food has to have pepper and this makes everything better. I took mine out of the bag and put it in a mason jar. I figure it will keep its flavors better in there.,1,0.727394

The price is kinda high yet you do get what you pay for. The coffee did not have a burnt or a bitter taste.

The taste is really nice - probably sounds odd but it reminds me of Fruity Pebbles :) You don't get a lot of the green tea taste. The lemon is the strongest flavor but it's not tart, it's mellowed out by the jasmine. I usually don't add anything to green tea but you could probably get away with some sweetener in this.

Celestial Seasonings makes a gentle Vanilla Chai that's not too spicy or too bland. So the variety out there is great. I was excited about the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-cups because I would be able to have a lovely Chai without adding sugar or milk to the brewed tea. I cannot drink a full 8 ounces because the taste is so weird. This Chai has a soy base instead of milk. I'm not opposed to soy milk at all and enjoy it on cereal but in this Chai it adds a funny taste to the tea. Maybe it has to do with the powdered aspect of the soy milk - powdered milk also has a strange taste. In any case I'm glad I only bought one 16 pack. It'll wait in my cupboard until I find a friend who enjoys it or it expires. I also did not find it too sweet as other reviewers did, but I like my Chai sweet.",1,0.726863

If it weren't a Compleat (which by Hormel's own apparent definition must me edible and little more), this would get my five-star applause. I grade on what is offered. Yeah, the potatoes are OK. The gravy is at least better than some others. The surprise? The meatloaf has some real flavor! I'm not normally a big meatloaf fan (didn't care for the singer, either); but this really ain't bad at all. Has spices and tastes like somebody really tried on this one.

9/3/2022,"For about a year now, I've been really been getting into tea drinking, not so much because I wish to increase in hipsterness, but because I've heard all of the health benefits and figured since I smoke, the least I could do is cut down on coffee and drink a few cups of tea a day, to reduce cancer risk as well as help the ole ticker and bloodflow, which has it's own benefits if you know what I mean... So far what I've discovered is Monkey Picked Oolong and Silver Needle White tea are by far my top 2 in taste. Since I'm drinking tea for health reasons, I don't add milk, cream, honey, or fancy German rock sugar as that would appear to defeat the purpose. (Yes honey is natural but still freaking sugar.) Those 2 types of tea seem to be naturally sweet, especially the silver needle white. I gave some to a friend and he asked how much honey I put in it. ""NONE, motha%#$@^! That @$#! is straight white tea, *&^%$!"" :O Most Black teas, even expensive highly rated ones seem to taste like hot unsweetened Lipton, meh. Rooibos tastes like it smells: Hay/cattle feed pellets, bleh, very disappointed. Pu'erh was decent but much like Black. I haven't tried loose leaf green tea yet but will soon. But Oolong? Yes please. I've tried several, including Teavana's Monkey Picked and it is indeed very high quality and perhaps a little more 'vegetal?, with giant expanding leaves but it's roughly twice the price of EnjoyingTea's, which is similar. And that's a very good thing, slightly vegetal /slightly sweet, and you can 'feel' it adding to your lifespan with every sip. Ah. I tried Rishi's silver needle white and it's just plain amazing but pricey. I just ordered some from EnjoyingTea and am guessing I will soon wind down the testing phase of my tea experience and decide on EnjoyingTea's Monkey Picked Oolong and Silver Needle White (pending taste test) as my 'everydayers' due to a yet unmatched combo of quality and price. 5 stars.",1,0.70611125

XyliChew is the only brand I've found that I can definitively say is NOT produced in China or sourced from materials produced in China. XyliChew is produced in Finland. Given China's contaminated products record the past few years, I would trust a product from Finland over China any day. The gum itself has a nice peppermint flavor that does not last too long.

30/12/2021,"I had to look for a new food for my 100 pound puppy. She has a sensitive stomach and sheds extensively when in that phase. And as many of you know, it is hard to find good food. I have ordered 3 small bags of different food/brands, this one was the first on the list to try. After 2 days, the coat of my dog got better and softer too. I would have not thought that it would work so fast. Poop stayed solid (I didn't have a problem with that on the previous food, but its important) and it doesn't have a nasty smell anymore, as with the previous food. Great again! She still sheds a little but the coat is getting much much nicer and I am confident that it is a matter of a few more days until it is in outstanding condition. ***After 4 days, the shine of my dogs skin is definitely noticeable. This food is high quality and it shows on your dog. We also got rid of the nasty gas which is as well a great indicator of a good food. I recommend this food over Acana, Orijen or other foods with high protein levels, as it is grain free!!! (very important). As for the price, Amazon is a fabulous website (& I do have Prime), however I was able to get 2 bags for $39.94/bag WITH shipping included on another website! And as I am typing this, I got additional on time 10% off .. so not even with Prime I would be able to get to that price. Anyway, as far as the food goes, it is very very good. Just be careful with the high protein levels, not all dogs might do well with it. Get a small bag and see how it works and of course mix it in with current food. If it doesn't work (lot of gas and loose stool after a week or more), try a different brand with less protein. You might want to look at Precise Holistic, Fromm Gold or Canidea alternatives. Very good foods but the protein is lower. Get small bags, try one, mix in little by little, if it doesn't work, go back to the previous food and than start with the other bag. In case of questions I will be happy to help. ***UPDATE: So after about two weeks of use, the coat is shinier as EVER, its absolutely beautiful. The last time I remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy. There is a little gas now and than, but nothing horrible (and I do feed my dog at night, so her stomach works during the night), stool is solid and still no smell. I also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears, food CAN cause ear and eye infection, so that is satisfying too. As for the shedding, it has almost stopped. Its 80% better!!! This is definitely the best food we have tried in 18 months. We have tried around 10-12 different brands. That gives you an idea of how good it is.

After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it. Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain ""Menadione Sodium Bisulfite"" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.",1,0.6137617

Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy. Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less. Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.

17/1/2022,"When looking at buying creamer, I mistakenly believed that this product would pair well with the coffee I enjoy (a cinnamon / vanilla flavored coffee). Listed below are my opinions about said creamer when used in both normal coffee (unflavored medium roast) as well as flavored coffee. Both types of coffee were ground that day. The good: The amount of creamer you receive borders on the ridiculous. The package has to contain near 8 lbs. of creamer. The creamer is individually packaged and arrives in four cartons (each containing 50 creamers). The cartons are easy to open and have a flap to allow for easy access. The bad: The creamer is VERY weak. To receive the same texture / coloring / flavoring as a traditional creamer (one in a bottle), you must use roughly 50% more of this creamer. The vanilla taste is very minimal. The cinnamon taste is very prevalent. the cinnamon taste is rather repugnant and almost has a sour taste to it. The individual creamers are rather hard to open (not that they are difficult to grab the flap, but there is a ton of glue used, and most often (7/10 times) will tear because the flap is glued down to heavily. ~~~~ In all, I would not recommend this product. I've actually tried to give the creamer away to several people, but after tasting it, no one wants it. Even at work, with the ~175 remaining creamers sitting there, after a week, the first container is still not empty (meaning, that of the 175 I brought, there are still more than 150 sitting there).",0,0.55981153

6/1/2022,"This Matcha is of great quality, if you have not had Matcha before, or if you do not want to spend alot of money on the more expensive brands such as Domatcha, which is one of the best! The difference in Matchas besides the telling prices, will be the viscosity, the texture,the nature of its froth and the color. The color should be a very bright green, and this tea is. This tea, however will not froth very thick after the pack has been opened and placed in the refrigerator after about two-weeks. Other very high quality Matchas will keep that capability, due to the inherent quality of the Matcha itself. This tea is smooth,and taste very good. If you can't endure the wait of ordering from Japan, or the price of other Matchas, you will not be dissapointed with this tea. You also need a bamboo whisk; there is no escaping this necessity! The whisk seperates this tea evenly within the water, and makes it blend with blue-berry and Pomegranate Juice, which is what I mix it with, topped off with a Mt.Dew or a little Sprite. Yummy! I love Matcha; I drink it everyday and hate when I run out. It's good for arthritis,detoxifying the body, giving you energy and inhibiting depression or stress. Enjoy.

12/1/2022,"I LOVED the Beaba the first two months I had it. I used it about twice a week for cooking food to store and twice daily for warming meals. After four months of use, the switch that engages at the top (safety feature) won't stay engaged, so I have to twist the top aggressively several times to get the machine to turn on - whether cooking or puree mode. So that's my first major disappointment. Second, the quality of the plastic doesn't seem to withstand the temperature of the steam, so the base of the main container has several cracks and leaks at the bottom. I am concerned about the plastic too - given how the steam is damaging it, I feel this may be one of those plastic that we are warned against heating foods in. For the price, I don't feel this product is worth it. Better to use a crock pot or food steamer and a Cuisinart.",1,0.66247034

Having eaten these for a year or more, I've had fresh ones from the local stores. The ones I received here didn't taste fresh and sometimes tasted stale.With rice cakes, that makes a big difference.

24/2/2022,"A subsidiary of Hersheys, Scharffen Berger is a small company in San Francisco that actually makes chocolate, from the beans. It deals directly with the growers to select and purchase high quality cacao beans of specific origins. Scharffen Berger does not advertise its chocolate as ""Fair Trade"" chocolate, but has a policy of not buying beans from the west coast of Africa, where the industry is know to practice slavery and use child labor. Note: this chocolate is not labeled ""organic."" This is a 41% cacao bar labeled as milk chocolate with sea salted almonds. The bar has a nice, smooth, glossy appearance. The smell is of a French confiserie. Yes, just close your eyes and draw a deep breath. This scent reminds me of molded chocolate and chocolates wrapped in thin foil with fancy ribbon. The bar breaks with a nice snap, indicating that the chocolate has been well tempered. Small pieces of chopped, roasted and salted almonds are evenly scattered within the bar. The chocolate melts is creamy as it melts in your mouth. You taste caramel. It is sweet but not too sweet. The saltiness appears after the chocolate melts, leaving the almonds on your tongue. The combination is very tasty. The chocolate has a pleasant finish, not dark, not overly sweet, just right. The allure of this bar was so intense, it required finishing the entire bar.

Obviously age doesn't hurt vinegar's function, and high quality vinegar can age like wine. But here, freshness suggests that the company has high turnover, which is a good sign. The capsules appear to be made with a very high quality gelatin (or whatever they use for these particular ones). While capsule quality doesn't seem like a big deal normally, when the contents are vinegar, I think it's worth mentioning. I feel perfectly fine taking these; no stomach upsets or other issues. I have only taken one daily (I think many people take too high of dosages of various products every day, which ends up causing problems sometimes if you aren't well educated on the vitamins and herbs etc. that you are using).

My co-workers (including a couple born and raised in India) think I'm a great cook when they sample one of my lunches, but it's really quite simple and ends up being healthier and cheaper than bringing a sandwich every day.

I also use it in a carrot cake recipe (equal substitution) instead of sugar where I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I don't decrease the other liquids.

21/11/2021,"For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks. I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out. I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them. I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice. I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total. With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order. $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons. I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler. packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks. I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it. First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher. The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices. The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry. I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal. To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.

18/3/2022,"Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!). I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc. The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands. Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another. Why? Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin. The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors. Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.

It plays hell with my diabetes but I just love creating some delicious dessert for friends when we have small gatherings. I usually buy vanilla beans in Tijuana, Mexico because I can get good quality at a decent price. By that I mean the beans tend to be supple, shiny, and aromatic. By ""decent price"" I mean it usually costs me around $1.50 to $2.00 per piece. When I saw this half-pound package at such a low price I was skeptical but I figured the $25 would not be a big risk and if they were bad I can always return them. I ordered on Jan 11 and got them Jan 13. Free two-day shipping being another great feature of my Amazon Prime membership which I now believe is an excellent value. The beans are very high quality. They are ""Gourmet Bourbon"" which means about 30% moisture (a good thing) and they are shiny and nicely oily (you want the oily surface as that is one part where a lot of flavor is located. The other part is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds scrapped when used). These beans are very fresh as shown by their flexibility (as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle- still usable but not as good). They come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag. Even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex. This is a large quantity of beans. If you are not going to use them rapidly I recommend separating into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those. For optimal shelf-life I keep mine in a wine refrigerator (it gets cool but not cold) where I keep my 20 or 30 pounds of various chocolates. This is an excellent deal on good quality.

More of the hazelnut flavor is often too much for moi. It's not the best coffee I ever had, but it's just fine considering that it only costs about $6.25 / lb in the current market (Millstone is about $9). My only problem is what the product is -- 5 lbs. It's hard to keep that amount fresh, unless you are a restaurant. When a package is opened, I package the full 5 lbs in Wal-Mart (...) coffee bags, 1/2 lb per bag, then double-bag it into freezer bags, and pop that into the freezer.

Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon, Zuke's Jerky Naturals. I will say that we tried two different kinds. Along with these, we tried the Wellness WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch . The Zuke's are really potent. When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are. They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one). The Wellness treats seem a little dryer. While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness. Plus they're cheaper so that's even better. He can't get enough of them.

This extract has the sweetness of 300 - 360 times that of sugar, is a Kosher product, and it contains no additives. Also the .4 ounce container is fairly small and has a shaker top, so it is easy to carry with you and use if you are away from home. You could even attach a very small spoon with a rubber band to the container if you wanted to be even more precise with your serving sizes. I started out using this in tea and I am now using it in my coffee as well. It mixes fairly well in hot drinks. It's easy to get used to the flavor in tea, but may take you some time in coffee. I think that it's worth it to take the time to get used to the taste. The end result is that for every teaspoon of sugar or serving of artificial sweetener that you ingest in your coffee or tea during the day, you will be substituting a dietary supplement that has been shown to be healthy to your gums and in some studies to lower high blood pressure. Every teaspoon of white granulated sugar has 4 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of sugar and 15 calories. If you normally have 5 teaspoons of sugar during the day in your hot drinks, you would be saving 75 calories per day - a good portion of the recommended 100 calorie per day reduction to help with long-term weight loss. The flavor of this pure extract compares very favorably with that of ground stevia leaf (blehhh!) which if you add it to tea will just float on the surface. Also as compared with Truvia or other stevia plus other sweetener products, it is considerably less expensive and the taste is pure - not multi-layered. If you want to enhance the flavor and it doesn't conflict with your diet regimen, consider adding a squirt of honey or a dash of table sugar to your beverage. I am looking forward to perfecting a hot cocoa recipe. Chocolate and cocoa seem to mask flavors very effectively. I am not sure how to use stevia for baking. That will take some experimentation and most likely require combining stevia with other wholesome sweeteners. In all fairness, I have only tried Truvia once in tea, and I found that it had an almost cooling effect on my tongue and considerably less sweetness than stevia. Many sweeteners come in single serving packets, and as a result they are considerably more expensive per serving. Why not start with a pure product?",1,0.69860446

26/3/2022,"In recent months I have become an Amazon.com Prime Fanatic. Why? Because you can buy a lot of good stuff cheap (meaning ""cost effective"")and have it delivered in two days for free! How can you hate that? But, Beware!! As President Reagan once said ""Trust but Verify"". I have actually corrected his intent because I think he was trying to be too Politically Correct; that is ""Distrust and Verify"". You must ALWAYS shop and reshop, internet and retail, to see what makes Price Sense. To the point: I can buy the 40 Oz. (2-1/2 Lb.) bag of B&J Kona Blend coffee beans in the decorative bag for $16.99 (No Sales Tax in MA) at my local BJ's. An aggressive Amazon.Com Marketplace Seller is offering the same item for $40.69 plus $8.24 shipping, $48.93 Total. I will not dignify the sellers price by speculating what the profit margin might be or what the final Unit Price results in. You be the judge. All I can say again is ""Distrust and Verify"". P.S. I defend the right of a company to gouge their customers. That's what Capitalism and America are all about. Flip side is that others will see the gouging and decide to sell the same product for less money- that's also Capitalism and what we're all about. I would encourage readers to comment on my opinion. Thank You.",0,0.5746316
4/1/2022,"Pop Secret is by far my favorite popcorn and I eat about 2 bags a day. I normally get the homestyle, but is was always to dry when I ordered on line so I went to the Butter thinking it wouldn't be so dry. No such luck. When I buy from the grocery store it is much more flavorable and fresh and it doesn't cost that much more. I checked the dates and the store vs online bulk was about 6 months different on average which probably causes the difference even though they both are in the sale by date range. with this said, I am going to have to discontinue buying this product online unless something changes and I'll really miss it coming straight to my door since I eat so much. I waited for 3 months of getting this product before posting because any company can have a bad batch of anything. Sorry. I hope this changes in the future!!",1,0.67965776
28/2/2022,"I really like this Namaste Foods ""Say Cheez"" gluten free, vegan macaroni and cheese style dinner. It's not Kraft Mac & Cheese but I like it a lot better than Kraft! It's zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese. I thought that the 3 tablespoons of oil they say to mix the ""cheez"" sauce with was excessive. I used one teaspoon of oil and 1/2 cup of the cooking water I reserved from the pasta and let it simmer while stirring for a few minutes to thicken. Then I added the pasta and green beans that I cooked with the pasta. It was really tasty! The macaroni, which was a nice texture and cooked up beautifully, has ridges to hold the sauce. Do not over cook the pasta though, it needs maybe 8 1/2 or 9 minutes. It's just way too expensive. I really think Namaste Foods could make money and still price this much better to be affordable for the average person. No need to price gouge people who have food sensitivities and parents who have children with Celiac Disease. I know this type of product costs more to produce because of the need for a dedicated facility and the special ingredients but your prices are ridiculous. Most families are on a strict budget especially in these days of poor economy and job losses. Even on Subscribe & Save this product was almost $4 a bag! Come on Namaste Foods.

22/3/2022,"Update: Please note per my information below: product description and photo are no longer accurate. The product has a sealed lid, not a ""pop-top lid"" and the amount of protein and sodium have changed. See below for the correct information. I have notified Amazon of this error. Somehow 5 grams of protein have been ""lost"" from the can contents. I purchased the 4.5 ounce can of Swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at CVS - buy one, get one free for $3.00 ($1.50 per can). This large size can 12-pack works out to be a better deal even though it's not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even more. I am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat. This 9.75 ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth that's easy to drain off or use. The chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful. It is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item. The meat flakes into small pieces easily, so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it. It would also make a good filling for enchiladas, tortillas or quesadillas. I have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product. It is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks. For those who don't like tuna, it's a great alternative. Basically, it's chicken when you need it ready to go, and it is a good source of protein with very little fat. One can contains 5 servings with each serving containing 50 calories, 9 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat, 25 mg of cholesterol (8% of DV), 1 gm of carbohydrate and 260 grams of sodium(does that include the broth?). If sodium is a concern, consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainer. It's certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long! It's fresh when you need it. I have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now. This chicken contains no MSG and no artificial flavor - just less than 2% food starch and sodium phosphates.(okay sodium phosphates may not appeal to some) Update: Just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheese. I haven't tried the concoction yet, but the chicken looked wonderful when I opened the can - appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast.",0,0.7125235

9/3/2022,"Golden flax seeds taste better than the brown variety. I grind them and add them to oatmeal, shakes, cereal, etc. They are a good source of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory compounds including ALA which may get converted to EPA and DHA (Omega-3s). This is especially good for vegetarians and vegans who don't eat fish but want to get more of these healthy fatty acids in their diet from a whole food source, vs. supplements. They have a light but unique taste that might be described as nutty, grassy or vegetal taste. The texture is noticeable and somewhat gelatinous when ground and mixed with liquid. They also work well as a vegan egg substitute and thickener. People sometimes add these whole to baked goods, but you don't really digest them or benefit from them unless you grind them. I think grinding them fresh is probably more likely to give you the best benefit vs pre-ground or oils, but don't know for sure.

I use to like Equal years ago, but it gave me a headache and I found out its a neurotoxin. Then I was using Splenda for a few years, which I really like, my favorite sweeneter actually, but was hearing things about it not being that good for you being that its chlorinated and all. I had tried several stevia products in the past and always threw them out because they were awful. I do find that Truvia has a bit of an aftertaste when sweetening tea. I did try it with whipping cream, using the amount of packets that would be equivalent to the amount of sugar I would use, and the whipping cream was pretty awful, I ended up adding quite a bit of powdered sugar to make it edible. I pretty much use Truvia for 3 purposes only: to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries as I still need a little bit of sweetness in my yogurt; my other low-carb dessert - just taking 2-3 oz cream cheese, a few berries, and one packet of Truvia. and my occasional black tea or ginger tea.",1,0.7111291

Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home. If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating. It depends on the cat. Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight. We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal. It has been a year since then and they are better. Then the formula for this food changed. We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us. We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food. It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick. Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have. Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating. Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!

25/1/2022,"On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it. Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product. What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli. While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all. ""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses. On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals. On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side. For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones. (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."") And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS. You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer. I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied. I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me. The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product. I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product... Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them.",1,0.6985053

Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity 2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes 3. Hypertension and Elevated ""Bad"" Cholesterol Levels 4. Long-Term Liver Damage 5. Mercury Exposure from HFCS Kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees,Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon.

12/2/2022,"They claim this product is ""unadulterated"", which would make you think ""oh! sweet! it's going to be the BEST, because nobody else's coconut oil says it's ""unadulterated"". I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states: """"Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures."""" Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products. I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website. """"What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use."""" If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying. Thank you for your time. -Amy PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc.",0,0.7006387

I was mortified to say the least... Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment. (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.) Me personally, I have not tried them. I will take his word for it! :) I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.

One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.",1,0.56623554

(My dentist said the same - only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario' pictures of teeth on battery acid. He put me off coffee for a week.) So, with that double-whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods. Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route. And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation. First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid. I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it. Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad. I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob: while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in. I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery. Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start. There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee. Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains. So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.

I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them. I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation. ""Stacey""'s review sold me on it: ""Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with ""meat by-product"" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be ""unfit for human consumption"". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered ""waste"" and packaging it up as ""healthy & nutritious"" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food. Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not ""sold-out"" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of ""aflatoxin poisoning"" from the ""healthy & nutritious"" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as ""Natural"", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their ""high priced waste"" and heavily marketing it as ""natural"". My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical.

The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.

30/3/2022,"Switch Orange/Tangerine is billed as the natural alternative to sodas and/or artificially-sweetened juice drinks. However, I found it to be pretty ordinary.

If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley. However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd. I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe. You know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat NOW because by tomorrow you'll need to put out for the birds? Not exactly something that I'd look forward to drinking.

It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day. The downside is a single 8.3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda. The Orange-Tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of Orangina. Perhaps you've tried Crystal Geyser's Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. It's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color. This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products.

Perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste; it's something I haven't tried before. Perhaps I got a bum can. Perhaps THE SWITCH just plain sucks.

And like all canned orange juice (Blue Bird brand, et. al.) there is an off taste to it that reminds you it isn't fresh squeezed juice. Add to that this fizzy aspect, and its just kinda, well, there. I can't say that this is a healthy drink - orange juice has some of the highest concentrations of sugars for a fruit drink. And its cost per can is steep, especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice.

20/11/2021,"Coffee is a very subjective thing. Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves. For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash. For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary. With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold. Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor. Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand. So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors. This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve). It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it. Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark. I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you. I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.

16/2/2022,"StumbleUpon users, be wary. I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some. Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend. After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking. The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience. I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money.",0,0.6513377

15/1/2022,"My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff. For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter. After we tried the Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets tablet, there was a small difference for both of us. For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning. For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the ""sweetest"" ones she'd ever had. However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes. Both of which tasted noticeably better. However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes. To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping). Would I try it again? After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not. I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).

So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised. I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her.

28/3/2022,"After reading all the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb (somewhat low calorie) snack that I can work into my low carb living. I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand. Wrong. I was first disappointed with the texture. After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth? Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones. But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste. Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor. They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get. So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you. It works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them. By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars.",1,0.67780834

21/11/2021,"Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake. I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible. Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.",0,0.65370595

Years ago ""Grecian Delight"" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.

In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.' The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water. The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn. If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long. The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar. With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week.",0,0.54697925

26/3/2022,"Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress.",1,0.6864824
29/1/2022,"Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!",1,0.7251719
14/2/2022,"I purchased this coffee on sale at my local Vons. They had it on sale for $4.99 a bag so I bought four bags -- can't beat that price, right? I figured, how bad could it be? It is beyond bad. First, if this is ""French Roast"" coffee than I'm Angelina Jolie. There is not on identifiably French Roast aspect about it. The taste is nothing short of horrid. I tried making a pot with more coffee and one with less coffee. Nothing worked -- it's just awful. I am taking back the three unopened bags as this is just undrinkable. I threw the open bag away. This is how bad it is: I have a can of Folger's in my pantry for those emergency mornings when you wake up and learn you're out of coffee. I poured out the Gevalia and made a pot of Folgers and it was better than the Gevalia. Since Folger's is barely drinkable, imagine how horrid Gevalia is. Save your money. It's not even worth buying when it's on sale.",0,0.6866361

22/1/2022,The bag we received from Amazon had hollow biscuits and were harder than the ones we purchased from a local store. Were these a reject batch? Certainly over baked or dried out! Our bichon had a hard time biting into it.,0,0.71976984
19/12/2021,"It appears Amazon may have gotten a bad batch, or they are very old. I was excited to find these as my Husky-Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either. They are expensive, but I decided to try them. When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them. I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldn't be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these. Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for.",0,0.64744014
29/3/2022,The last bag of these I got from Amazon had a lot of hollow bisquits. It was weird ...... they just weren't solid like they should be. I'm going to switch to another brand of grain-free dog bisquits now as there's no sense in paying for something I'm not getting (and these are expensive!) And if it wasn't for the good packaging I'd wonder if bugs had gotten to them..... but I don't think that's possible.,0,0.71287525
5/3/2022,"These look very tasty and me being a candy freak i had to try them. To say the least i was extremely dissapointed. They have a chemical taste and the texture is like chewing glue. Very nasty, i would never eat or buy these again and that goes for any of the flavors.",0,0.70464545

17/1/2022,"This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The ""hot chocolate"" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter. If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere.",0,0.7182787
