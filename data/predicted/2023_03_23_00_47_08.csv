7/7/21,I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.,1,pleased natural balance dog food dogs issues dog foods past someone recommend natural balance grain free since possible allergic grains since switching issues also helpful different kibble size larger smaller sized dogs,dog food
18/6/21,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",1,educated feline nutrition allowed cats become addicted dry cat food always offered canned dry wish would fed premium quality canned food limited dry food two year old cats two year old cats good quality dry foods eat wellness innova innova manufacturer recently purchased procter gamble began looking replacement offering several samples local holistic pet store holistic select one usual wellness innova would eat finicky cats recommend trying holistic select good quality food palatable finicky eaters,sugar
7/7/21,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!",1,holistic vet recommended along brands tried cats prefer especially sardine version best part coats soft clean eyes clear want rude say delicately waste far less odorous cats eat mcdonalds junk found stores definite plus health benefits obvious highly recommend holistic select,sugar
1/7/21,"I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants. I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does! I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it. My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee. I will follow up on this product in a few weeks. :)",1,bought coffee much cheaper ganocafe organic reishi mushroom well healthy antioxidants expect taste good actually days totally worth sisters take ganocafe introducing less expensive similar coffee follow product weeks,coffee
