I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement.

7/7/21,"We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick. My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one. I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it. They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max. I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.

It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later.

I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well.

Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life. After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian. Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications. I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy. His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight. I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's. It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after. To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.

I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants. This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.

1/4/21,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy. He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).

She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him. I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco.

But my 9-year-old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda. It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda. While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks.

17/4/21,"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit. Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet. I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case! While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz.

28/9/21,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened. It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children. So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth. You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket. Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour 1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water.

23/9/21,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also. I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT! When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma! Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau. I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years. They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it! If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet! They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food. The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'. I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time. One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it! I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'. The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes. What's good for one cat might not be good for another. You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them. While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it! I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!

26/6/21,"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"": Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock. I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some. I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise! But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.

10/1/21,"Pros: No added sugar (1 g per 2 Tbsp serving) No added salt (30 mg per serving) Great taste Organic No stirring needed Cons: Expensive, even for sunflower butter (we paid $6.20 per jar here at amazon, with free shipping) Thin consistency (closer to a pourable topping than a 'butter') A bit higher in calories than many nut/seed butters (220 cal per serving) This makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies (facility is peanut and tree nut free) or someone just looking for variety. It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is. On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower. It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness. We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either. It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter. Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.

I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty.

Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber. I gave some to my dad to try.

I've tried the mixed nuts they sell locally, which have a lot of peanuts mixed in, and the difference in quality is pretty noticeable. These are much firmer, fresher, and just taste overall better. It seems the filler nut they used here were almonds, which is fine, and certainly better then peanuts, but it's unfortunate that pecans are scarce. Brazil nuts are pretty generously packed in as well, with moderate amounts of hazelnut (Filbert) and cashew. You get a lot of salt near the bottom, naturally, but otherwise there's just enough mixed in to assure that they stay flavorful from the moment you open them.

30/7/21,"This is an extremely tasty seaweed snack. The biggest plus to this product however, is the fact that it is roasted with Olive Oil. Most commercial seaweed snacks are roasted in rancid, unhealthy canola oil or soybean oil. So the only option for health conscious people was to buy the raw nori sheets and roast them ourselves, which is fine but a bit of a pain. Kudos to SeaSnax for stepping in and filling the void. The only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product. Hopefully others will get in on the act and competition will drive the price a bit.

They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to ""junk"" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent ""in between"" meals snack.

20/9/21,"Since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made (when meat by-products are listed among the ingredients, it is usually from questionable sources, gross at best, dangerous for the pet at worst), I have decided to look for a healthier option. I found Merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use (here are the ingredients for the flavor Grammy's Pot Pie, my cat's favorite): Chicken, Chicken Broth, Turkey Liver, Fresh Red Jacket New Potatoes, Fresh Carrots, Fresh Snow Peas, Fresh Whole Red Delicious Apples, Potato Starch-modified, Olive Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Tricalcium Phosphate, Cassia Gum, Carrageenan, Flax Seed Oil (For Omega -3), Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary) Choline Chloride, Salt, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Copper Amino Acid Complex,d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Acetate, Niacin, Lecithin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide, Cobalt Glucoheptanate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin,Thiamine Mononitrate, Sodium Selenite. If you pay attention to the first ingredients, you will see that there are no meat by-products or grains, a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food. My cat really likes this food. It comes in many other flavors, and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones I have offered her. What also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any 'supermarket' pet food. The meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish, but in a disturbing, pungent way. Also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat, which my cat also likes and that are good for her. Sure, this food is a little more expensive than other products, but all in all it's well worth it.

22/6/21,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)). He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!). I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)!

8/7/21,"This is one of my favorite healthy cereals. It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent. Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal. I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax. The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal. The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market. It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup. As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast. However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier. However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals. I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor. This gives me the best of both words. However, this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like Kashi GOLEAN to be too bland.",1,one favorite healthy cereals good mix textures flavors sweet indulgent eating definitely feel like eating health nut cereal huge fan banana really enjoy distinguishable sweet fruity flavor lend cereal well slight nuttiness flax green tea really subtle almost undetectable really affect flavor cereal downside cereal little calorically dense healthy cereals market calories cup grams fiber grams protein kashi golean cereal ounce boxes pack calories grams fiber g protein cup result optimum rebound filling find feeling hungrier faster kashi golean breakfast however flavor optimum rebound much sweeter complex understandably sacrefice nutritionals bit something tastier however still much healthier many mainstream sugary cereals find typically making difference mixing optimum rebound kashi golean flavor gives best words however still great cereal overall especially appeal find cereals like kashi golean bland

The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads. What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all. Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off.

2/5/21,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand¬Æ Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand¬Æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors.

19/1/20,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet. My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either. Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.) Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",1,recently low carb diet find longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave honey dates raise blood sugar spikes insulin hormone whose message store fat insulin also causes kidneys retain water therefore would bloat high carb diet dilemma love sweets problem thanks products like stevia natural plant safely used parts world sweetener hundreds years calories impact blood sugar although people might bit brain tricked thinking getting sugar stevia used legal usa cosmetic product politics companies made low calorie sweeteners aspartame want competition yet aspartame gave headaches even sometimes symptoms multiple sclerosis would use stevia times aftertaste bad honest crazy taste either tried nunaturals product awesome like stevia tried delicious also aftertaste unless put way much common mistake people new comes tablets powdered form bottle handy packets individual servings also comes alcohol free liquid form even vanilla flavor unlike aspartame becomes even toxic heated stevia used baking nunaturals stevia baking blend since raw fooder cannot tell tastes sure good judging products thanks great products low carb raw diet deprived sweets

5/6/21,"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor). While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage. While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.

9/7/21,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them. Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen. The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess.",0,tried love thai food ginger coconut problem mess even vaguely resemble thai food discernible ginger coconut taste plus noodles stick together even prepared suggested come big clump try eat also nutrition label misleading dieting read labels carefully says serving one cup also says one package weighs oz half cup figured say otherwise type meal usually one serving adding water would one serving per package one package actually two servings calories far pre packaged noodle meal seen excessive calorie content might ok product tasted good would definitely recommend stay away mess

For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper.

5/6/21,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point. I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor. These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays. I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say. ****SUMMARY**** How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to) Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding. Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %. If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side: **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%), Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2% So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better. I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit. At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down. (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2) )",0,love amazon love reviews people introduced alot great products b c reviews time total complete let popchips stars right perplexing get generally sorta want give packaging pretty aesthetically pleasing extra point ordered thinking would would maybe slightly better version baked lays man wrong tried baked lays flavors go first original baked lays sour cream baked lays since favorite regular lays discovered bbq baked lays seriously fantastically great bbq baked lays packed much flavor popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips literally good baked lays definitely see eating much less could benefit say use portion control zip lock bag bunch baked lays trying think ways go detail really much say summary popchips taste like slightly burnt air chips sort weird taste takes alot getting used would suggest buying eager try say buy bag local grocery store week ordered saw local krogers definitely expanding nutrition information bag oz g calories total fat g sodium mg total carbohydrate g dietary fiber g sugar g protein g vitamin vitamin c calcium iron buy big bag bbq popchips big bag bbq baked lays nutrition information side side pop chips serving size oz g chips calories total fat g sodium mg total carbohydrate g dietary fiber g sugars g protein g baked lays serving size oz g chips calories total fat g sodium mg potassium mg total carbohydrate g dietary fiber g sugars g protein g vitamin c calcium two close baked lays wins virtually sodium since potassium mg offsets sodium mg leaving g potassium plus fiber vitamin c importantly taste better one careful sodium intake fact baked lays potassium huge benefit end day make decision would strongly advise purchase bag store first maybe even compare favorite flavor baked lays popchips almost guarantee baked lays win hands hopefully amazon starts selling well priced variety single serve bags baked lays soon found one seller price seems little high bags instead smart mix variety pack count baked lay classic baked cheetos baked ruffles baked doritos nachos cheese rold gold tiny twists pack

The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center. This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.

We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food. SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely.

29/6/21,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box). These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits. The results were very tasty. The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original. If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe. I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right. I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each). The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag????? I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right. So, there must be a misprint on the box. I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits. If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half. You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly. This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good. Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need. About these biscuits: yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones. Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color. Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork. That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter. It will cost you as much as a box of this mix. The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk. The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum. Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy. Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour. It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all. For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone. Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising. The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency, and yes, they are necessary. As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten). You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease. Can you just make your own mix and spend less money? Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix. The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken. You can find more recipes on their website. I recommend this product for the taste. I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.",1,ok bought bisquick gf first thing tried make drop biscuits recipe listed box kind rolled cut drop biscuits results tasty taste gf bisquick much like original taste tart original want similar buttermilk taste need use buttermilk instead milk biscuit recipe noticed something else odd might problem anyone new cooking seems amount mix called quite right read side box claims cups mix box servings cup biscuit recipe called cups mix measured heaping teaspoonfuls measuring cup even cup mix left bag know mix wheat flour maybe kind flour measures differently maybe dug bag cup would used less recipe came right must misprint box assuming measured properly biscuits dipped gravy smothered butter jam sliced make yummy mcdonald breakfast sandwiches following instructions lot biscuits single cooking two might want cut recipe half still plenty go box quickly mix cost around enough left make anything else without buying another box biscuits really really good still watching budget prepare need biscuits yummy fairly golden recipe calls eggs sliced crumbly edges like glutenous ones without eggs probably get nice eye appealing color even though drop biscuits still cut shortening margarine cutter need use long fork difficult celiac craving biscuits buy cutter cost much box mix biscuit recipe also calls milk want nice tart taste reminiscent original bisquick need use buttermilk mix made rice flour sugar leavening potato starch salt xanthum gum many mixes goodies made rice flour taste grainy bisquick done fantastic job rice flour grainy repeat grainy new celiac cooking using starch corn potato tapioca normal adds lightness baked item would possible rice flour alone leavening simply baking soda powder necessary rising sugar salt flavor consistency yes necessary xanthum gum perfectly natural ingredient gives celiac safe baked goods bit elasticity acting replacement gluten find xanthum gum every baked goodie made people celiac disease make mix spend less money sure difficult time finding rice flour finely ground rice flour predominant main ingredient mix recipes listed box pancakes waffles strawberry shortcakes pizza crust ultimate chicken fingers oven baked chicken find recipes website recommend product taste wish mix box price

31/7/21,"This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste. There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees. It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa. I really enjoyed this. The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself. When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands. However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried. We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups). This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable. The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.

18/10/21,"Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor. No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried. Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands. I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf. No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner. Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement! I love using my Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold for coffee, tea, and cooking. I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6) and filter cone (similar to this one: Ready Set Joe/Mug ) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor. Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee. This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby. Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee). Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob! You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor. I look forward to ordering more.

23/1/21,I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it. It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee. Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal. Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!! Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.

7/7/21,"Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar. Plus it is organic! It does contain high-glycemic cane juice, so I don't drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic. I don't know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information. This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.) This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles. The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though. West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor. Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere.",1,wow tastes great sweet chocolaty like liquid chocolate bar plus organic contain high glycemic cane juice drink much original vanilla flavors sweetened low glycemic rice syrup less sugar organic know ingredients say canola oil neither good karma website label box ingredient verified site correct good karma corporate website label carton wrong would stop using product perhaps page outdated ingredient information richest milk like rice beverage label mention canola oil contains toxic erucic acid found many rice beverages fed children canola oil cannot used us fda regulation infant food one research paper found higher levels erucic acid red blood cells autistic children compared non autistic children many well established toxic effects erucic acid humans animals look medical journals product sold neighborhood ralph best price vc discount whole foods los angeles brand whole foods brand also canola free much cheaper watery comparison use cooking plain vanilla flavors though west soy rice beverage also canola free neutral taste less body chocolate flavor many people find rice milk better tasting milk substitutes find much easier digest soy nut products soy milk however much protein aside hard digest eat much soy anti nutritional components get protein elsewhere

I didn't weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.

I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup. I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers. Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value. I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going. It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going. I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that. I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising. The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them. I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.

Since it's a carbonated beverage I'd probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldn't have to be shaken before drinking. That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price it's being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine). For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados). There's acacia gum (as a stabilizer probably, don't want to have to shake a carbonated drink) and then additional natural colors and flavors, ascorbic acid and soy. My 13yo daughter and I shared a can and liked the taste. On a par with Orangina. My personal preference would be for a little more carbonation, but this was ok. I'm a traditionalist so I definitely prefer a 12oz. can, the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped, but then, I prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor.

Not too sweet at all. The label says there is no sugar added. Fine, as it doesnt need any. The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies. Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C. Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?) I could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff.

At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isn't something I would regularly drink.

Each can has 34 grams of sugar, 100 vitamin C, and 20% vitamin A and not much else.

21/4/21,"As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, Black Cherry and Orange Tangerine . I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry. Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories. I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors. The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice , for example. The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice or San Pellegrino Orange although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands. In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.

To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting. I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up. The taste of the drink itself was satisfying. Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland. However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice. More on the side of mixed syrup with water. What kills this product is the high price.

17/4/21,"I'm always on the lookout for soda's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals.

10/3/21,"Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level. Bottom line: If you're die-hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If you're a die-hard juice drinker, stick to juice.

21/4/21,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty! To give you an idea of what it tastes like: Take orange juice. Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage. Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go. Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges. My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*). Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him. After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!). My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.

I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job. It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave. I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds. I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.

26/9/20,"These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh ""homemade"" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully ""explode"" or ""bloom"". The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results. The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat. My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand). As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result. This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway. The jury is still out on whether the ""healthy"" claim can hold water. I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.

Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds. I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth.

17/10/20,"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding. The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave. I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it.

2/9/20,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."" So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist. We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)

I use peanut butter as a mid-day energy boosting snack -- straight off the spoon and without any other food to supplement it. It's just THAT good to me. I was more than happy with Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy. I like the smooth texture it has, and it has a great mouth-feel that isn't the thick ""stick to the roof of my mouth"" kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat. I don't feel that Skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product -- it tastes delicious and satisfying.

16/10/21,"There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea. This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality. It is not drinkable plain. Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness. I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible. In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves. What should you drink? Anything you like. I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase. I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"". It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant. What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff. By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.

18/10/21,"I am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie's flavor is; it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious. 300 calories seemed a bit high, but I ate one with a large glass of water and it has been 4 hours and my tummy is not growling yet, I even worked out too. I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist. I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too. I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something. The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch. I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie, it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime. Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;) I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave. I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven. I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there. UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime.

These breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious ! I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!! I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! My only wish is that they came in a variety box so one isn't forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor. Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic !

4/8/21,"How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one.

23/7/21,"I remember the old Shake N Bake commercial from when I was a kid (""It's Shake N Bake, and I helped!"") and was curious to try it again. My sample pouch had enough to coat 6 boneless pork chops, each almost a half inch thick. Each pouch is designed for 4-6 half inch thick bone-in or boneless chops. It was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water. No messy clean up.

11/6/21,"I have been using Shake `n Bake with my chicken for year but never thought to use it with pork chops until they released the Original Pork flavor. This product is as easy to use as their other products: pour the Shake `n Bake into a sealable bag: put the pork chops individual, shake and then put them in the oven. The package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four I would not be surprised if I could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package. The taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when I forgot I was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with Shake `n Bake on it. Much like the chicken version, the breading can fall off while cutting, but that is really the only negative I can say about the product.",1,using shake n bake chicken year never thought use pork chops released original pork flavor product easy use products pour shake n bake sealable bag put pork chops individual shake put oven package says used four six pork chops using four would surprised could able coat four pork chops one package taste similar chicken version bites forgot eating pork chops eating chicken shake n bake much like chicken version breading fall cutting really negative say product

Other than that this product is great. It is so easy to use. I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four. It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking. I found the coating to be delicious. It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork. The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside. Just crispy enough. It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork. I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal. I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more. I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again. Highly recommended.

There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars.

My research led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries. Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non-protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.

Perhaps, it might be better if you only added a bit of the packet to tea, or only used a bit of the packet in the water because, the ginger is very overwhelming.

6/2/20,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein. First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein. Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried. As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either.

3/4/20,"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form. So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way. This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another. Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...] Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness.

7/8/19,"I love honey and I often buy expensive gourmet types. I decided to try this one because ""rain forest"" sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic. This honey met my best expectations, it has very nice texture and aroma to it. For this price, I couldn't believe it, it does taste like a gourmet honey. I disagree with one of the previous comments. This honey's taste is NOT overbearing at all. Good quality honey should have a distinct flavor (that's what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types) and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey.",1,love honey often buy expensive gourmet types decided try one rain forest sounded unusual also labeled organic honey met best expectations nice texture aroma price could believe taste like gourmet honey disagree one previous comments honey taste overbearing good quality honey distinct flavor sets apart honeys coming different areas flower types easily recognizable flavor valued type honey

13/1/20,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar. There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good.",1,bars roll types hard eat actually part like much take effort bite chew basically force eat slower result feel satisfied end eating one scarfed candy bar three bites find hard rocks though chewy like chewy food definitely also really like texture contrast crunchy crispy outside chewy nougat inside bar bit mess factor involved eating noted one reviewer caramel sticky sometimes leaves traces wrapper outside crispy crunchy coating tends crumble bit want keep inside car spotlessly clean might want chow go lean roll bar driving nevertheless still think best bars discernibly chalky strange chemical aftertaste way many protein energy bars really like fortified candy bars pack quite high protein fiber punch calories mg sugars tablespoon per bar expecting like mg tried first one chocolate turtle roll favorite flavor honestly tried every single flavor go lean roll bars really quite good

9/10/21,"Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals. The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples. The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat. I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors. The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good.

I agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping. In my area I could not find it in the Asian stores so I have to order it. For three bags the shipping was just $1.50 more than the shipping for one bag so I bought three to offset the shipping cost. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later. I love the tea hot or cold with or without cream.

I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink.

10/2/21,"We picked some of these up this week. They're very convenient and quite handy to have around just to grab when you're walking out the door. The taste is about what you'd expect from Hershey's chocolate milk, it's chocolate, it's sweet, and it's really good. It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened. On the one hand these are better for a child than cola, but on the other hand there's still a lot of sugar in them and 200 calories in only 8 oz. I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them. When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up. I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet.

I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste. It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix. The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds. There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth. Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks. There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.

30/6/21,"When I was a kid, Post used to make a cereal called C. W. Post. It was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best. It disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the 1980's. Fast forward to today. Walking down the grocery isle, I noticed the single row of just bunches, high on the grocer's shelf. Over the years, I had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the C.W. from my childhood. Sampling all that I could find, I had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste. Likely this new find, Just Bunches, would also disappoint, but I figured I should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what I remembered. It was from the Post people, perhaps they reached deep into their cereal recipe box and revived an old flavor from the past.... One could only hope. It the parking lot of the Grocery, I cracked open the box to give it a taste. Instantly I was transported back to my childhood, munching on cereal and watching Saturday morning cartoons, the road runner, bugs bunny, it all came back... I had found the 'holy Grail' of cereals.... ok, maybe that's taking it too far, but man its really good.

Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's. I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat. Here's how the trial went: Me: opening the bag ""you want a treat?"" Dog: tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently Me: I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her Dog: She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. ""sniff, sniff"". She looks back up at me. ""sniff"". She walks away and lays down in her bed. Me: I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything. This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog. I pull on the outside ""wrapping"". It's pretty tough. I push the middle up a little. It's hard! I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle. It's tasteless. I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly ""bite of cheese"" ritual. Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it. The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.

The bottle is quite small. 8 fluid ounces is the two-thirds the size of a soda can, so the amount of sauce you get really isn't very much at all. They make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity. The concave curves on the side further deceive the eye.

The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt.

25/5/21,"Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag. I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, ""the VUE"" that uses different and patented cups.",1,coffee preference matter taste opinion regarding taste probably mean much would try coffee tell soft bottom cups certainly different usual plastic k cups initially concerned well would work keurig making fifty brews work perfectly loose grinds left behind pod well mug anywhere else cost little less k cups nice plus minor drawback come plastic bags opened allow exposure pods air simple fix put remaining pods ziplock bag like taste french roast coffee fact also cheaper competition hopefully patent k cups expires september see vendors offering better prices probably keurig recently came new brewer vue uses different patented cups

I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years.

28/7/21,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me. As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added). It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here. As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310. This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110. This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810. The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor. These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce. The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other. After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one). It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure. If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both. At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too. You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving! But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made. In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.",1,pretty tasty eat sort thing admit rare guilty pleasure compared brand doubt main competitor thought one tasted better probably already mixed almost cheese sauce included also replaces milk usually added pretty much toss terms nutrition given looking nutritional champ begin prepared one calories per serving calories fat one mg sodium one kraft velveeta cheesy skillet comes slightly ahead overall protein g compared g dietary fiber g compared less gram competitor differences probably attributable cheese sauce sauce also pushes one edge total fat g one ground beef added difference recommended daily amount vs virtually none good fat either one significant although brands claim zero transfat also list partially hydrogenated oil one ingredients meaning certainly contain transfat less half gram per serving would require full disclosure eat whole package cups realistically dinner leftover lunch two easily might could get whacked much g transfat mention saturated fat ground beef add grams sodium probably need skip another meal day avoid going recommended daily value sodium might consider fasting day plan eat one serving said guilty pleasure definition nutritionally sound choice made case things price availability equal probably choose one choose

12/10/21,"I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them. I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare. Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness. It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand. The chips are little hexagons about 1"" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.

11/3/21,"I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch. These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus. Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions. There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc. It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good. One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale. My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip. The expiration date on the bag is in November. With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away. My only hesitation would be the price. Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.",1,munching chips type trying keep salt fingers going keys like way taste flavors mainly stone ground corn tell ingredients well nice nutty aftertaste like texture right amount crunch chips overly salty either another plus nutrition wise chips rank among healthy versions calories one ounce serving lot less normal see similar products amount fat sodium lot lower got g fiber average daily requirement trans fats cholesterol preservatives etc seems foodshouldtastegood company made sincere effort produce healthy product possible given ingredients requirement make something tastes good one reviewer said chips hard tasted stale experience chips tasted fresh crunchy means harder crunchier regular tortilla chip expiration date bag november preservatives seems odd bag reviewer tried expiration date year away hesitation would price currently chips stock amazon pricing given would say would evaluate whether wanted pay much chips even though seem better health brands taste good well
10/4/21,"I just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner. Luckily, the Velveeta Cheesy Skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry. I browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions. It was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it. The ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo I think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and Velveeta cheese sauce. After browning the chicken, just add the seasoning and pasta along with about 2 1/2 cups of water and cover. In about 7 or 8 minutes, add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another 2-3 minutes. Then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce. My kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone. I found it to be better tasting than Chicken Helper and easier to prepare. My only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli. It was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets. Of course, you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier. Overall, a good choice for a hectic night when you don't have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed.",1,got home long trip faced making dinner luckily velveeta cheesy skillet dinner sitting pantry browned pound chicken breast strips followed directions quick easy dinner family everyone enjoyed ingredients come different packets pasta orzo think seasonings dehyrated broccoli velveeta cheese sauce browning chicken add seasoning pasta along cups water cover minutes add dehydrated broccoli cook another minutes remove heat add cheese sauce kids loved plenty everyone found better tasting chicken helper easier prepare complaint miniscule amount broccoli like sprinkling dried parsley broccoli florets course always add fresh frozen broccoli veggies make healthier heartier overall good choice hectic night much time cook lot hungry little mouths feed

2/8/21,"I recently went on a gluten free diet. Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast. There is barely any flavor to this cereal. I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon. I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good. It really isn't filling. The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk. I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think. Could I add sugar? Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy. To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend. If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush. If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness. It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises. I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day). It is cheaper than granola. When I can afford it, I'm totally getting outrageous gluten free granola. I also have envirokids to try next.",0,recently went gluten free diet hurts far breakfast barely flavor cereal picked mine whole foods amazon would rather fortified vitamins even though sure would taste worse least would taste good really filling barely darkened milk taste chocolate though lose good taste thing taste milk know rice flavor general lack flavor hint staleness think could add sugar sure would taste sugar sugar substitute make healthy fair bitter salty sweet sour anything offend eating fast enough mush stopped making noise danger mushiness makes truly good snap crackle pop noises suppose cereal bad enough encourage eat fresh fruit good taste mouth remember take daily vitamin take every day cheaper granola afford totally getting outrageous gluten free granola also envirokids try next

This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too. Tips to enjoy it: - Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum. - Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well. - All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can. - Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it. - Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous.

You just purchase the Frappuccino Mocha, pop it into the refrigerator, let it cool down, pour it over ice, and you have delicious iced coffee, sweetened and creamed just how I like it. What's not to like? It is expensive. But I suppose when you add in the cost of the half-n-half, the coffee, the sugar, and the time to make it, it's not that bad.

28/3/21,"I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon). That's all I got!

24/2/20,"Since visiting Hawaii, I have fallen in love with Passion Fruit Juice. This flavor is hard to find, even in California. Often other tropical flavors are mixed in. This tastes exactly like I expected it too. It is very concentrated. I am happy with about an ounce in a 20 ounce bottle. I add water, ice and Splenda to taste. The directions say to mix the 16.9 ounce bottle with 8 more bottles of water = makes over a gallon. As far as I can tell, it is unsweetened. It does contain some preservatives including cirtic acid, sodium bezoate and metabisulphite. This comes from Brazil. Great product!! I use it for juice, to flavor Greek yogurt, and to add to a white or yellow cake for a tropical flavor. You can also make a great pie. Follow your favorite lemon chiffon recipe, and use this instead of the lemon juice. I will be buying more.

The noddle's in this Yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what I am use to in the ramen packets that I normally eat but are very tasty. As with most of these type products it is easy to prepare and the flavor can be adjusted to your taste by the amount of seasoning used. I reason for only 4 stars has to do with the container that is used. After it is cooked in the microwave and the lid is peeled off there is a sticky adhesive left around lip. Not a problem if you are going pour the contents into a bowl but kind of gets in the way when eating directly from the container.,1,knowing like ramen sister suggested give try second order really enjoy flavor texture noddle yakisoba different flavor texture use ramen packets normally eat tasty type products easy prepare flavor adjusted taste amount seasoning used reason stars container used cooked microwave lid peeled sticky adhesive left around lip problem going pour contents bowl kind gets way eating directly container

25/1/21,"I have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years. I consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand. They are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon). In nearly 40 years, I have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., Swiss Miss, Carnation, Nestle's). One powdered cocoa is from the LDS Church and it's almost impossible to get in Kentucky. The Distribution Center is in Indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of Preparation Specialist; therefore, no one goes to Indy very often. The second great cocoa was made by Cold Stone Creamery. It was sold through Walmart and was as smooth as the Church cocoa. Unfortunately, Walmart no longer stocks it. I'm not sure it's even manufactured any more. Yesterday I ran across Stevens Cocoa. It was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so I decided to try it. I knew that if I didn't like it, I could take it to work and give it away. I'm in love. This stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the LDS Church and Cold Stone Creamery. One sip and I was hooked. It dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good. I top it with Redi-Whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help. I'm headed back to stock up on more cans. If it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know I can get it from Amazon. I never thought I'd fall in love with a product enough to buy it from Amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but I'm making an exception for this cocoa.

The creme is purportedly peanut butter-flavored, but, to be honest, I was unable to pick up any of that. It was still tasty, just not as peanut butter-y as I'd hoped. The fudge coating was not too thin, not too thick, just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness. What else can really be said about an Oreo?

After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat. I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up. Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it. His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much. He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day. He's so much happier and plays more.

18/6/21,"I am shocked at the positive reviews for this tea. It is almost completely tasteless, just a slight fruity flavour, it does not resemble any green tea that I have bought in the past when living in Japan or from Asian markets in the USA.

This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price. Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price.

Fine with me as I like coconut, I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time. I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip. Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly. Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy. Honey is sugar. Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories. Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks. I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.

At $3.99 per bottle (Kraft's listed price on their site, not Amazon's), you're paying more for the bottle and the wow-factor than the actual flavoring itself.

10/8/18,"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go. With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them. The pasta turns out just right, and the sauce is pretty good too. The Rotini with Zesty Marinara Sauce has a nice, garlicy zing to it. The portion size is just right for an entree; it is a little small if it's comprising your entire meal, but if you're eating at your desk, chances are you didn't have time for a full meal anyway. The plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk; no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose-walk it down the hall before your fingers burn. A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg. Two, there's quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal. It's nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase, but when you take the layers apart, you can't help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch.

They only have 40 calories and 4 grams of sugar, and contain lots of Omega 3 (880mg!!), Omega 6, iron, potassium, calcium, fiber, protein, magnesium...they are extremely healthy.

8/6/21,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched. ""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?"" ""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge."" ""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?"" ""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied. I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be. When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood... You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above. In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.",0,recently watching celtics game friend apartment game grew intense consequently grew parched hey brian said got anything drink yeah replied got lavender soda fridge lavender soda asked skeptical person even get lavender soda sitting table next couch furniture section marshall bought brian replied walked kitchen interest piqued drinking lavender soda sounded like wonderfully unique experience typically enjoy scent lavender soaps however would soon learn drinking flower flavored soda would exciting experience hoped would took first sip thought gotten time initial flavor tasted like club soda poured glass contained soap residue previous cleaning interesting thought perhaps flavor subtle first however drinking experience continued came realize would case swallowed soda faced aftertaste rather tasting like soap residue tasted simply like soap like bar soap mouth brought back horrible memories childhood see young boy mother would always threaten wash mouth soap either said bad word said something disrespectful father one always question mother conviction often found bar soap mouth tremendous lasting psychological effect even twenty years later still taste flavor soap mouth consider saying bad word consequently took first taste lavender soda hit flood emotions felt though said bad word broken rule felt though punished something could recall done vision began become cloudy began lose control small motor functions soon reduced bluthering mess floor bombarded deeply buried memories vowed never sip soda long shall live lest suffer another episode one described summary soda tastes like lavender scented soap soda might better suited delicate palate personally prefer

The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.

The name ""Old Bay"" refers to the seasoning of the same name (normally associated with seafood), so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect.

If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect). Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed. When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.

5/6/21,"Even though the price is always fluctuating it's always been less than I would pay at a grocery store even when that store has a sale. In my opinion De Cecco makes the best pastas on the market today. And Penne is my favorite because it's versatile, working well in many dishes, and because it's easier to make sure it stays al dente. I don't think I've ever cooked it so long that it went to mush though I suppose if you really tried you could do it. For many years I fell back on spaghetti noodles but then switched to penne never to look back. I even use it for a less conventional noodles salad with mayo with a touch of milk stirred in and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dusting of fresh or canned parsley or basil thrown in. With the `subscribe and save' ordering you can save another 15% and you'll always have this stable on your pantry shelves.",1,even though price always fluctuating always less would pay grocery store even store sale opinion de cecco makes best pastas market today penne favorite versatile working well many dishes easier make sure stays al dente think ever cooked long went mush though suppose really tried could many years fell back spaghetti noodles switched penne never look back even use less conventional noodles salad mayo touch milk stirred shredded sharp cheddar cheese dusting fresh canned parsley basil thrown subscribe save ordering save another always stable pantry shelves

I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.

9/3/18,"In the past, I just didn't use tomato paste very often. That's because most brands are just nasty. We'd always have a can of Hunt's or Contadina around, but I'd always be disappointed whenever I used them. It's really annoying to, say, make homemade enchilada sauce, have it taste mediocre, and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste. Amore, by contrast, actually keeps the bright tomato flavor. Since it's in tubes, there's none of the ""tinny"" taste so common to canned foods. And it's so easy to squeeze out a small amount that I use it all the time. There are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor, but which don't justify opening a whole can of paste. (Not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.) There are only two mysteries about this product for me. First, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. No other tomato pastes I looked at contain fat. Since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, I have to wonder where this fat comes from. The second mystery is that they label the box as ""double concentrated."" As far as I can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: I still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands. But I'll forgive Amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling. This has become a cooking essential in my kitchen.",1,past use tomato paste often brands nasty would always hunt contadina around would always disappointed whenever used really annoying say make homemade enchilada sauce taste mediocre add insult injury throw away half leftover tomato paste amore contrast actually keeps bright tomato flavor since tubes none tinny taste common canned foods easy squeeze small amount use time sorts soups sauces benefit little tomato flavor justify opening whole paste mention fact canned pastes would make food taste worse better two mysteries product first tablespoon serving grams fat tomato pastes looked contain fat since ingredients tomato paste salt wonder fat comes second mystery label box double concentrated far tell concentrated tomato paste still use exactly amount recipe tastes better brands forgive amore mysterious fat exaggerated labeling become cooking essential kitchen

11/9/21,"Have never been a big meat-eater, but cut back even more a few months ago. I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein. Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well. I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy). According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of BTM, in water. It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day. I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash). Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.

I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time.

I've been trying to get him to lessen his diet coke intake (which is 1-2 a day) but he just waves me off. So I did some research, read the reviews, and bought 2 packs of the cola and lemon flavor each. I tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water. There was no taste! It literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor. I can't imagine anyone WANTING to drink this stuff, let alone rave about it. Did I get a bad batch? My Dad will never be able to transition from diet coke to this stuff, cause this stuff is truly awful.

19/2/20,"In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.

Every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops. The sweetness of Turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland, and this confection is a fine example, so long as one doesn't eat all that sugar sifting around in the box. I think there's so much so it will act as a natural preservative. If you can't fit a quick trip Turkey to get the genuine article hand-made fresh, then this is the best imported substitute I've tried. I wouldn't trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf-life issues, and I wouldn't trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet, but on-line through Amazon I trust.

I don't understand what the fuss is all about. It does look a little different from what you may be used to seeing, but works just the same. Now as to the taste of the coffee, I think that it is a full body flavor. If I want a strong taste I brew regular size amd if I wish to have a milder flavor I will brew the largest cup size, I have the best of both worlds. I immediately went on subscribe and save. I order 5 boxes at a time. Love the flavor of this coffee. Now to my complaint.

When I tasted a tiny bite, it was just a little bitter. The bar is divided up into blocks. When I put a block in my mouth, it was awful and I ended up spitting it out.

30/5/21,"This is the first cold coffee drink (without crushed ice, like a Frappuccino at Starbucks) I have ever had. I do enjoy coffee, but during the Summer I often turn to soft drinks instead (I usually do not want a hot drink when it is 100 degrees outside). I was not sure what to expect from this, but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing! Being a Cappuccino, it has low fat milk (which is nice, since most places just use whole milk), and a hint of cocoa (not too much where you cannot taste the coffee, but there is a hint that makes it perfect)! Because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has 100 calories, 1.5g of Fat (1g Sat Fat), 19g of Carbs, and 18g of Sugar (from label). That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have. The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly. When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa. I am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee (especially during these hot days), and with only 100 calories it is a great start to the day!

6/5/21,"If you are already a fan of illy coffee in general (whole bean, ground, espresso), most likely you'll enjoy this can of Cappucino Coffee. The flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk (lowfat) added. The bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk, so hopefully if you decide on this drink, it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor. There is also a hint of sweetness though I did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can. The can indicates that it shouldn't be shaken, so maybe this is expected? There are 100 calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt. The can indicates this is a product of Denmark and is distributed by the Coca Cola company. The weird part here is that illy is an Italian brand... guess it costs too much to import from Italy? No idea there.

6/7/21,"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh? Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good! The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers. ~ Ana Mardoll",1,pasta knorr sauce parma rosa creamy tomato bioopw pardon rave incredible pasta mix totally love sauce love eat pasta usually confined higher fat alfredo sauces cheese sauces acidic tomato sauces irritate acid reflux means spaghetti meatballs frustrating life eh browsing sauce aisle knorr alfredo packets found parma rosa sauce idea vodka sauce reviewers reference whatever good describe would call creamy tomato alfredo even though creamy also light pleasing taste cloying tomato taste exquisite acid content low enough prevent stomach pains taste absolutely wonderful actually talk impulse eating promising parma rosa later good knorr sauces fairly easy make instructions serious say stir constantly though think helps preheat milk adding powdered mix store indefinitely dried packets another reason buy packets besides smaller carbon footprint shipping versus jars oh buying amazon means get half price local market parma rosa also add third pound seasoned browned ground beef easy meatballs portions easily get two full meals one sauce packet sauce stores perfectly fridge coming person generally hates leftovers ana mardoll

Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years). A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh. They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using. The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor. It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor. Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned. The Chanterelles are a mild, less earthy tasting fungus. They go very well with eggs, chicken and fish. They are also great in a stir fry.

I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it.

7/8/19,"I've tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee I've experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success--including grinding my own beans, buying expensive ones at specialty shops, etc. This product, while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee, comes closest. It is somewhat expensive at about $9/lb. Supermarket coffees are, of course, much cheaper--and you can get larger packages at discount places for much, much less. I even tried mixing this coffee with Folgers--and it was pretty good too. Naturally, this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker. I drink coffee straight up--no sweetener, no milk products, but I like it pretty strong--but not burnt or over-roasted. This coffee is not over-roasted or bitter (unless you use too much of it).

9/3/18,"UPDATE JANUARY 2011 I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious steal! I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds. I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that! The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.

18/5/18,"I have long been a fan of German based Melitta products, and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees, and even some so called ""exclusive"" or ""select"" blends. Blanc et Noir is one selection from their Cafe Collection, which I would put in the medium to dark roast catagory. A full bodied flavor without acidity, but not too strong. That is when made in French press, I don't use old style ""leave it in the pot all day"" machines. A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks. So it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste. If you like European style ground coffees, you may also like to try Douwe Egberts Intense - Real Coffee Dark Roast Ground Coffee, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3) which is Dutch, or the bold flavored Jacobs Kr&ouml;nung Coffee, 8.81-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 4) .

8/11/19,"I've always been a little curious about barley tea, as I see it often mentioned in manga and Japanese stories. I finally got a chance to try it the other day with the Sokenbicha brand. This tea is not sweetened, which is part of the reason I purchased it. I'm on a diet, so I prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like Splenda or Equal. I didn't really need it with this drink. There's a slight bitter tea taste, but it's definitely not overwhelming and I didn't really think that it deterred from the drink. To be honest, I didn't add any sweetener to it at all. It didn't need it and I think it would have killed the taste. There's a great nutty-ish type of flavor that I'm going to assume is the barley. I adore it and while I don't think I'd be able to drink it constantly, I really want to drink this again, to the point where I'd be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that's about a half hour out of my way. I do have to warn you, if you are a fan of the more traditional teas (black tea, iced tea, etc) then this will take some getting used to. It's tasty, but I can see where it wouldn't be to all tastes. Still very much worth trying and I'm definitely going to be looking for barley tea in general. (But stuff like this is good for me to take to work, where I can't brew up big batches of tea.)",1,always little curious barley tea see often mentioned manga japanese stories finally got chance try day sokenbicha brand tea sweetened part reason purchased diet prefer sweeten beverages stuff like splenda equal really need drink slight bitter tea taste definitely overwhelming really think deterred drink honest add sweetener need think would killed taste great nutty ish type flavor going assume barley adore think would able drink constantly really want drink point would willing drive organic grocery store half hour way warn fan traditional teas black tea iced tea etc take getting used tasty see would tastes still much worth trying definitely going looking barley tea general stuff like good take work cannot brew big batches tea

My active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal, she's usually hungry within a couple of hours. This kind held her for 4 hours.

At first I got the mixture wrong-- I put 1 tsp into 8 ounces of water. There was too much of a citrus-like after taste, and of course the flavor in general was too strong. Once I got the mixture right (use 1/2 tsp for every 8oz), my opinion changed. The flavor is great, and I love it!

13/6/20,"I think the negative reviews are a little harsh. This company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized. Is it right. I agree no, but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not. So at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative. ALL almonds in the United States are pasteurized. You can go to health food/ co-oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds ( my store has some from Italy), but if you go to Whole Foods they are also going to try and sell you ""raw"" almonds that are not truly raw. Everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling. Anyway...google it and get educated if your interested. If you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you won't be disappointed with this one.

Because they're not individually wrapped, they can stick to one another in the package (although not to the extent that they're destroyed). Also, because there is no wrapper, although they are a decent snack for kids, they tend to leave little hands sticky. This order was for a dozen boxes.

So, I was really looking forward to trying out the Pomegranate Licorice. When you first open the package, you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate. The next thing you notice is the rich red, well pomegranate, color. One thing I liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a Twizzler. They are shorter and more manageable to eat. They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers. Taste wise, they are great. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet. While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers. The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft. The pomegranate taste is subtle. At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors. As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor. The pomegranate flavor is also very good. I haven't ate too many raw pomegranates but I do like the POM juice products. This licorice compares well against the POM juice products. So, as a nice treat to share with the family, I highly recommend.",1,already fan newman organics line products think generally high quality reasonably priced great track record charitable organization really looking forward trying pomegranate licorice first open package immediately smell sweet sugary fruit scent pomegranate next thing notice rich red well pomegranate color one thing liked right bat licorice sticks super long like twizzler shorter manageable eat also overly sticky leave sticky residue fingers taste wise great perhaps favorite aspect licorice super sweet strong sugary smell obnoxiously sweet like twizzlers licorice nice chewy texture trends towards soft pomegranate taste subtle first cannot taste instead tasting sugar gelatin flavors chew pomegranate taste grows end nice strong flavor pomegranate flavor also good ate many raw pomegranates like pom juice products licorice compares well pom juice products nice treat share family highly recommend

25/9/20,"That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try. First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me. FYI Nutrition info: Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box Calories 140 Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat Cholesterol 0 Total Carbs 18g Fiber 2g Sugars 0 Protein 2g Sodium 50g BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people. Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag. Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.

I also like that Lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags, and they aren't wrapped individually. (The teas that do so annoy me, as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster - there's no need to wrap each one!) I especially like the taste of the tea - it has a very nice flavor. Note: I use 9 bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea.",1,already fan buyer lipton herbal tea tried island mango peach mandarin orange blueberry pomegranate like fact ingredients natural hibiscus flowers rosehips blackberry blueberry raspberry definitely herbal tea actual tea leaves ingredients caffeine free also like lipton uses least amount material needed make tea bags wrapped individually teas annoy wrapped bags time waster resources waster need wrap one especially like taste tea nice flavor note use bags time make full pitcher iced tea

6/8/21,"Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters is a tasty snack that I enjoyed quite a bit. It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation. Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking. The most obvious ingredients are oats, almond bits, cocoa, and cinnamon. Neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all, and I found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than I would have expected. Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon. After all, a small serving contains 6 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice. But as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do OK. Overall I am a fan of Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters and would likely buy it in the future.",1,eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters tasty snack enjoyed quite bit exactly health food think would issue enjoying treat moderation eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters made large granola clusters big eaten easily breakfast cereal right size snacking obvious ingredients oats almond bits cocoa cinnamon neither cocoa cinnamon taste overpowering found combination two tastes much better would expected mentioned would consider product health food despite claims package antioxidant power cocoa cinnamon small serving contains grams fat grams sugar among ingredients listed brown sugar palm oil evaporated sugar cane juice substitute highly processed sweets ok overall fan eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters would likely buy future

20/2/21,"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising. Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it. One can also taste the sucralose. It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes. The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste. I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip. The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this! Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.

27/3/20,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home. Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs. When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony. Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long.

8/8/20,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy. Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food. Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void. There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me. I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price. Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids! Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :) Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly.

When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).

12/8/21,"This is a good product and very high-quality. The majority of people who post on Amazon (and the internet) are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition. There's a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula. As for this product specifically (Similac Organic), it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value. We've had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to breastmilk. Abbott labs (product maker) is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in-place, published research, and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community (exacting standards). That said, I would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula (ie. other organic products suggested as ""better"" in these reviews - especially the referenced small-name organic powders). All said and done, the components in ALL of the Similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well-researched in published studies. I'd trust this brand - Similac, over the smaller, no-names. Plain and simple.

25/5/21,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA. With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try. The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so. I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend. Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly! Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again.

25/5/21,"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet. Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol. I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used. The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment] When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.) Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact. The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest. I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value. I highly recommend this ghee.",1,ghee indulgence ghee viewed essential vitamin supplement albeit one tastes really good ghee especially necessary vegetarian diet opinion healthy addition diet research shows ghee even lower cholesterol performed extensive survey top ghee products available compared quality value ghee important addition diet quality sacrificed especially small amount ghee needs used ghee comparison table found blog see link comment started ghee comparison primarily interested finding best value organic ghee products however learned several products go well beyond organic standards pleasant surprise find high quality ghee products available also great see two top picks available amazon com grass fed organic ghee one top picks high quality ghees available focused understanding product authentic ghees much authentic others information table link reflects fact focus evaluation gourmet cooking optimum health therefore concerned first ghee product healthiest rank grass fed organic ghee one best products grass fed organic ghee made accord ancient traditions phase moon chanting etc great quality great tasting product good price makes great value highly recommend ghee

I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early. Not these. They have perfect consistency and flavor. The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces. [Update: I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year. The quality has be consistently excellent.} I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet. They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats. They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off. Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones. (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.) The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume. To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container. This is a great product.

17/4/21,"I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers. I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead. Mistake. I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon). When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing. I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter. That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new). I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale. When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing. It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise. That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there. I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again! I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots). I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy. The directions said to put in ""160ml of water"" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct. Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml. Seriously?!? So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct. I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery. There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix. It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either. I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver. If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time. You just set it and walk away. But the end result leaves much to be desired. And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth. You're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way.",0,bought product target done thought enough research baby food makers originally going get baby bullet reviews good went brezza instead mistake remember people written poor quality bad customer service company amazon opened tape used secure within plastic bag melted sticky stuff bottom thing scrub soon took box gotten sticky melted tape kitchen counter annoying plastic covering buttons looked like lifting used something even though brand new tried motor worked terribly loud would probably rate noise scale went wash prior first use course directions said remove driveshaft prior washing said turn canister find knob turn counter clock wise driveshaft must welded took husband hour loosen enough get honestly scared put back fear would never get back got prepared make first meal carrots followed directions cut carrots appropriate size went put water discrepancy directions said put ml water canister premeasured line could used amount water would correct normally would problem except measured line read ml seriously left trying figure one correct ended going premeasured canister think much water carrots came ridiculously watery also still chunks carrot mix easy get food around blades either see people would say might time saver worked decent quality would save time set walk away end result leaves much desired price would expect least get money worth honestly better getting really nice food processor going old fashioned way

19/2/21,"I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc. Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store. It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff. It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away, If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands.

2/9/20,"I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before). The coconut milk was thick and creamy. If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top. I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk. The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same. This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of. There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency). Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk. I did notice some slight differences on the cans. The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand. The watery cans that came with the subscription had a ""KLBD"" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka. Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information. I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order. There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away. The packaging of the subscription order was a mess. It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up. I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it. The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall. The other can was in good condition. If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars. The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review.",0,placed first order product march pleased received never tried coconut milk coconut milk thick creamy shake opening layer tasty cream top finished first case end may decided sign amazon subscription plan roland coconut milk new case arrived quickly content cans time coconut milk watery flavor fond layer cream top sounded differently shook much thinner consistency products roland organic coconut milk notice slight differences cans thicker tasty non subscription cans australian certified organic copyright product thailand watery cans came subscription klbd symbol certified control union certifications copyright product sri lanka cans listed ingredients nutrition information also note problem packaging first non subscription order minor dents cans nothing made consider throwing away packaging subscription order mess completely falling apart fell box picked actually opened box slid cans opened holes one fell dented think result fall good condition reviewed product receiving first order would given five stars lack consistency product quality poor flavor nd order lead give product star review

25/9/21,"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required.

Second, I trust Earth's Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wife's tale. Are you people saying that you don't give your babies fruit and vegetables? They are all sweet. The only reason I gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five, is the price. I can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar.

I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price. No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying. In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting: organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step! As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle. Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber. The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag. I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods. Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste. It reminds me of pureed fresh produce. While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.

What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter. I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea).

4/7/21,"I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years. My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium. Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable. An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee. Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance. That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts. When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct. It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.

2/8/21,"I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong. I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises. I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear. PS.

22/3/18,"These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison. Tastes good to me, though. I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that. I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!). Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.' Or just iced tea? :D Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened. That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great. Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind. I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them. I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C. If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great. You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences. Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just ""soaked and shaken."" I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew. There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative. As for this specific brand, as I said, it's the only one I've tried, so I don't have a standard of comparison -- but I'm satisfied with these, think they taste fine, and they were sold for a great price.

Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the ""scientists"" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr. update: after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now. 5-month Update: A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food.

17/5/20,"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment. Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it? This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup). Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans). Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time. There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers. 1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat. 2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more. It only takes a little to make a cup. Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself. But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant. Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence. If you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, I'd say at least give this a try.",1,canister gives cups coffee nickel cup cannot beat means money premium coffees like starbucks seattle best get cups assuming cup took day days week year would spending coffee alone money save car payment even starbucks tastes little better really worth coffee taste good premium taste bad either coffee afficionados would let think honestly starbucks via stuff way expensive cup granted instant good really fresh cup freshly ground coffee tastes better coffee coffee freshly ground especially pre ground coffee bricks cans freeze dried retains freshness longer time kept air sealed get fresh cup almost every time two big downsides ounce containers first time get bottom canister might experience staleness exposure air affects even freeze dried coffee one possible solution seal small batches keep away light heat easy add much instant coffee cup takes teaspoon teaspoon half one cup nothing takes little make cup overall nescafe taster choice offers great balance cost savings taste good fresh brewed perhaps especially get freshly ground coffee make certainly better coffee get say diner restaurant cafes make better cup worth unless occasional indulgence one people always scoffed instant would say least give try

It is so dark and rich, with a chocolate taste and a great body- reminds me of a good Americano (blows a Starbucks Americano out of the water).

This makes a very strong brew, so I add about 2 or 3 ounces of hot water to round it out. My only complaint about these pods is the consistency. It seems like I get a bad, bitter tasting pod here and there. There is also kind of a dry aftertaste. But in all honesty, it could be something I'm not doing right in the brewing process.

I use to use Equal many years ago, but it gave me a headache and I found out it was a neurotoxin. Then I started using Splenda, which is the best in my opinion as far as taste goes. But now you hear about it not being that great either (healthwise), being chlorinated and all, so I stopped using it. Then I tried Truvia. Like I said, it's not the best - it does leave a bit of an aftertaste with tea, and using it for whipped cream did not work at all, I ended up having to add a bunch of powdered sugar to the cream to make it edible. I primarily use it to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries, as I still need a touch of sweetness, so one packet is great, tastes good.

14/12/20,"There was a lot of food in a small package here, which was a pleasant surprise, honestly. Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this. The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers. The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste. I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper. And the chocolate square is nummy. :D The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself. The plus sides are that it is portable, it's tasty and it's quite handy. Will I buy it again? I think so, honestly. Sometimes I don't have time the night before to pack up a healthy lunch from home and in that case, this would be a great way to stave off the temptation of the dreaded vending machine or the temptation to call out for pizza.

Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings.

The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.

14/1/21,"I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting. The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo. The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in ""Better of Dead"" (no raisins in it though!). I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it. When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife. I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy! A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.

25/5/21,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase. I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday. who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon. For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!) I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back. Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around. I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch. Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao. Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure. It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know. So go ahead, get the big bag. You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened. You better believe it goes fast!! I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot. Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil. I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

24/3/21,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding. The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But... Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal.

These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.

The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.

14/12/20,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem.

15/10/21,After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there.

Texture and flavor: The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings. The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.

I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.

1/3/20,"I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review. It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product.

It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"". To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.

No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks. Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly. ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said. This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel. There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.

4/8/21,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this.

18/7/21,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range. The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease. His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food. Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats. Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight. This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them. Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks! The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each. We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full. We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff. The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for. Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened. I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available. If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two. Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive. With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae. Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again. This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.

15/6/21,"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options). The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now. Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food. My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record. I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

4/9/21,"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests. Three sample fortunes are: ""Life is not a struggle. It's a wiggle."" ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things."" ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work."" These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites. A fortune is: ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not. What matters is that they state a fortune.

1/7/18,"With Green Mountain Hot Cocoa being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot. Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price. Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be. As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or "" Splenda "" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure. ""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners. The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds. The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.

DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products.

13/7/21,"I was really excited and surprised when I found this mix in my local Wal Mart.

SOOOooo, before I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away.....

22/6/21,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software. Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level. I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level. This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether. BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones. *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor.

1/8/21,"I have been using a standard XLR to USB cable with my Shure 58 dynamic mic, which works okay, except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings. I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues. When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a ""test"" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers. This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go. I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7. The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver. Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way. So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue: ""Icicle compatibility with Windows 7"", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7. Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information. It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle ""techs"" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable. They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us ""technical support"", then say so. If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service. I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies. Windows 7 has been out for some time now. There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS). I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.

The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl. I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.

30/1/21,"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free. Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk. Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes. I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes. The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients. In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle. That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice.

17/4/21,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes. I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for: #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high. Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt. Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick: Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil). That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN. That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience. Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor. It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple. Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon). Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum. Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix. I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick. But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product. MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE! Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months. Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder. Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder. It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups). To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""

I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes. Because I thought they sucked, frankly. They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless. My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something. Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.

I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled. Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.

She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans) Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me. In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death!

15/7/21,"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving. Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar. The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing. It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams. Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before. But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate. How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me. I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet. Then there is protein. The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving. Not bad for a snack food. Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein."" Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet. I believe those are significant sources of protein. I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts. I did notice they were high in sodium. What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher. I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings. I just looked up Fritos Corn chips. A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving. So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package. For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement. A little steep for a snack. Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon. If they had, I would not have purchased it. They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term. Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it. To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste. They have a chemical, nasty taste. I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy. I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.

13/8/21,"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count. I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!! First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows: hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil. I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix. Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG. Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!! BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP. I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them. An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health. When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is. I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site. WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!! I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!! Not a good buy IMO.

5/6/21,"I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET. Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water. I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own). I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!

9/7/21,"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA. I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food."" That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids. So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now. (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars). This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form. All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form. Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line. I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage. But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.

28/7/20,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares. The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.

I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away.

18/5/18,Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.,0,many people buying food believing safer made new zealand made us performance pet products feeding food cats since recall horror prior change excellent food thrilled since ziwipeak switched canning us nightmare several times last year opened food find green blue colour return cans made cats vomit loose stools also recently found large sharp bone pieces present large strange chunks greyish pink material looks like connective tissue contacted us distributor twice never replied batch got month expiry date caused severe vomiting shedding cats previously healthy

27/2/19,"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes. It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe. In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients. All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have. One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.

3/4/20,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn. Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have. In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes.

20/11/19,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising. I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

17/3/20,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me. Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things. Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck. Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average. And now Switch has come along. True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it. Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients. That's great. So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love. This drink, however, failed to meet their promise. Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well. Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have. I've had mineral water with more bite. But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39). On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.

Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail. To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.

Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on. Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups. So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid. After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working. I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result. I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.

I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!

I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively.

13/6/20,"Little lesson on TRUFFLES... Truffles graded ""Extra"" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use. Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing. NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.

21/1/21,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish. On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ¬Ω year-old registered female Pug. Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone. I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves. I find this absolutely appalling. I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child. And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product. And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder. She's simply devastated - and angry. And so am I. Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children? Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug? Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands? I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can). And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on. I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone. I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone. I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows. He certainly appreciates those visits. But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier. Spencer will turn 12 in May. Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues. Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog. And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today. His dog has given him something special - the gift of life. Something which Purina has stolen away from us. You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man. But tragically that's not the case. Yet there's more. We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill. Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion. And like us, he's now subdued. He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why. This concerns me. I am a professional photographer and writer by trade. I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence. Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well. As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later. The guilt is killing me. How can I write? How can I do anything? Grief passes they say. But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime. And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented. Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it. So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem. In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with. In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product. And why should such a product even exist? Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard? Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores? The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence. A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life. We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor. I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words. It's now the closest we can get to our special friend. We are utterly distraught. Greta, only 2 ¬Ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever. It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina. The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.

AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item. A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering. Anyone want some tuna? O well. P.S.

Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included: Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients) Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol) Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural"" quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.

The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients. Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.

12/12/19,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html) Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?"" Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream. Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple. So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because: * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say) * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces * a combination of the above two factors * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools. Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers. Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything. When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining. The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling. The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining. Top Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac¬Æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard. The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass. The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting. Top Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication: * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders. * I use a lot of Karo¬Æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice). Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see: Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember"" ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula."" For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5. * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation. * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur. * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.) * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac¬Æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.) Top Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation: * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems. The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas. * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo¬Æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.

16/1/18,"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are: INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE) Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either. I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust. Apparently not. So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were. I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones. I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted. I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack. Very waxy on the tongue. Not nice like good chocolate would be. So I tried the butterscotch ones. Where the heck was the flavor? Well I was shocked when I read the label. I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings. I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk. And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things. Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them. In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags. If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good. Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.

21/10/19,"I went for these, when I got a free 30 bucks to spend with a new Amazon Credit Card, and Im glad I didn't pay full price. I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom. I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space. I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them. In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.",0,went got free bucks spend new amazon credit card glad pay full price process creating authentic bolognese meat sauce wanted hearty mushrooms add bit oomph sauce meat onion heavy figured reviews meaty tasting mushroom also see price asked local giant eagle grocery stores yeah get bargain rip pricing basically taking freezer space ordered two grades higher grade bigger shroom pieces less stems etc retrospect ordered scraps even dust found big pieces stayed nasty tough chewy texture even hours cooking also extracted juice mushrooms broth strong enough bother basically chop food processor add lot get change flavor recipes one ounce bags even bother takes lot get flavor honesty used another poricini product cannot compare disappointed results got may exactly supposed one tender palate case ever going rehydrated served steak stay nasty product serve strictly good grinding using recipe

Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did.

I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND.

I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats. Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect.

17/4/21,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats. Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes? Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky? I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring. Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.

17/4/21,"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater. However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.

He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate.

28/9/21,"I ordered three packages because the price was so good, then I saw this. I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused. Copied from FDA web site. FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians. FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings. Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities. FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died. FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant. The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]",0,ordered three packages price good saw asking amazon refund otherwise going trash unused copied fda web site fda continues caution dog owners chicken jerky products november food drug administration fda cautioning consumers chicken jerky products dogs also sold chicken tenders strips treats may associated illness dogs last months fda seen increase number complaints received dog illnesses associated consumption chicken jerky products imported china complaints reported fda dog owners veterinarians fda issued cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products consumers september preliminary animal health notification december seeing number complaints received drop latter part fda seeing number complaints rise levels concern prompted release earlier warnings chicken jerky products substituted balanced diet intended fed occasionally small quantities fda advising consumers choose feed dogs chicken jerky products watch dogs closely following signs may occur within hours days feeding products decreased appetite decreased activity vomiting diarrhea sometimes blood increased water consumption increased urination dog shows signs stop feeding chicken jerky product owners consult veterinarian signs severe persist hours blood tests may indicate kidney failure increased urea nitrogen creatinine urine tests may indicate fanconi syndrome increased glucose although dogs appear recover reports fda involved dogs died fda addition several animal health diagnostic laboratories working determine products associated illness dogs fda veterinary laboratory response network vlrn available support animal health diagnostic laboratories date scientists able determine definitive reported illnesses fda continues extensive chemical microbial testing identified contaminant fda continues actively investigate problem origin many illnesses reported may result causes eating chicken jerky veterinarians consumers alike report cases animal illness associated pet foods fda consumer complaint coordinator state go

You might get three cups of ""hot chocolate"" per container if you like the ""flavor"" really mild. It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price.

I love licorice, and have bought Gustaf's licorice on Amazon before, to much enjoyment.

Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my brand name Gustaf's licorice packages. Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers. Strike one - utterly stale Strike two - not returnable Strike three - no declaration of ingredients pre-purchase, only offensive legal CYA [Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date) - those rules are growing on me!] I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward.
