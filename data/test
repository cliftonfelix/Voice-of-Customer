0,positive,18/6/21,This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.
1,positive,7/7/21,I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.
2,positive,18/6/21,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters."
3,positive,7/7/21,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!"
4,positive,1/7/21,"I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)"
5,positive,7/7/21,"Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'"
6,positive,23/7/21,A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!
7,positive,20/7/21,"A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !"
8,positive,19/7/21,"I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes."
9,positive,18/6/21,"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon."
10,positive,7/7/21,These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend!
11,positive,27/6/21,"I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again."
12,positive,21/7/21,"I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!"
13,positive,18/6/21,"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!"
14,positive,7/7/21,"I have a free sampling of these chips and I can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings. They remind me of Munchos, but are less greasy. Try them."
15,positive,30/6/21,"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!"
16,positive,1/7/21,"I absolutely love Pop Chips as a healthy alternative to regular, fatty chips.  The Seat Salt and Pepper and the Sour Cream and Onion are my favorites.  I don't crave regular chips at all!"
17,positive,24/8/21,"I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.<br /><br />Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.<br /><br />It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt-free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)"
18,positive,21/7/21,I love these chips! They always make a great healthy snack when I'm stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance.
19,positive,25/6/21,"The 'Sun Chips' are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un-palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime.  All are good except for the 'multi-grain' style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood."
20,positive,13/9/21,"This chips are really good and it's fun getting the variety pack.  Now, are they as good as ""regular"" chips?  Probably not, but they're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  Given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, I would highly recommend them!"
21,positive,18/6/21,"Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag"
22,positive,7/7/21,"We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."""
23,positive,15/7/21,"I am a mom of 3 kids. With my older two I had such a hard time finding a snack for them that didn't have so much sodium! When my 3rd came along, HappyFamily introduced HappyMunchies. I was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too! And to top it off, it is organic so I know it is free of pesticide residue and GMOs!"
24,positive,11/7/21,"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store."
25,positive,7/10/21,"I love VitaMuffins, but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for $6.29.  Instead I bought the mix, 3 boxes for $16.00, and each box makes 12 muffins. Instead of $1.62 per muffin, the mix only requires water & eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin, and very easy to make. That's a great deal."
26,positive,6/7/21,"I generally like vitalicious products. The corn muffin, well, for 100 calories it's not bad. But if you are expecting anything like the sugar/fat laden junk that your local bakery sells, look elsewhere. this is like a healthy makeover that doesn't quite cut it, but they're not bad. For the same amount of calories, the chocolate one is more of an indulgence, but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat, especially baked fresh.<br />My kids are happy to get any extra snacks, so they approve...i send with them to school for a midmorning snack. im glad they get fuel and vitamins."
27,positive,18/6/21,"My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste."
28,positive,7/7/21,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:00 Mins<br /><br /></span>These cookies are so great! Watch our video to see how great they really are!!!"
29,positive,27/7/21,"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing."
30,positive,13/7/21,"It's also a routine baking ingredient. I put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour. I also put it into my smoothie, stir fry dishes....anything you can think of! Good price and really, it's a must have for a healthy diet!"
31,positive,13/9/21,I have tryed the Almond Crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips Try it you'll agree
32,positive,7/9/21,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
33,positive,17/4/21,"Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it."
34,positive,10/3/21,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.<br /><br />This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right."
35,positive,17/4/21,"I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)"
36,positive,21/1/21,"These chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you. True, they have almost the same sugar, fat and carb amounts of the best-known name brand of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand. This is a plus!<br /><br />They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.<br /><br />Overall, these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best! I definitely recommend them as an excellent, healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie.<br /><br />I love `em! Enjoy!"
37,positive,30/1/21,We like this brownie mix and I usually use the low fat recipe on it. I also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry.<br /><br />We still buy this by the case.
38,positive,13/2/21,"These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!)."
39,positive,15/1/21,"We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor."
40,positive,6/3/21,"I am not sure why the 2 speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out. The cakes are 18 calories, crunchy and good--not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes. Excellent as a base for PB&J, or to make an open face sandwich, or to use in pieces like a chip for dips, etc. Good price on the 12 pack with a 10 month expiration use date."
41,positive,8/6/21,I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious. Thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. Dense...not full of air. I covered them with PB2 (those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular PB and it tastes exactly the same). I too highly recommend these rice cakes.
42,positive,7/1/21,"Over 90% of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get 1 or 2 stars out of 5 or 6. Diamond Naturals is a great food. I have 6 Afghans and I've spent many, many hours of research to find this out."
43,positive,17/4/21,This is a very good snack that I feel great about offering my 10 month old.  She can easily  pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste.  My 5 year old loves them as well!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone with small (or larger) kids.  :)
44,negative,10/3/21,"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!<br /><br />So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!"
45,positive,14/1/21,"Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture."
46,positive,24/5/21,"Stores are not carrying this product - thank goodness I can still get them!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMHMUC"">Genisoy Soy Crisps, Deep Sea Salted, 3.85-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
47,positive,14/10/21,"I was really surprised when I tried this product because I found it to be a really light & fluffy batter. So don't think gluten free means flavorless, this Bisquick Pancake Mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family. It's so nice that these are healthier for you, diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too!"
48,positive,7/2/21,I HAVE A 7 YEAR OLD SCOTTISH TERRIER WHO HAS SOME FOOD ALLERGIES. NO WHEAT FOR MY GIRL. :) THIS TREAT IS GREAT FOR SETTLEING AN UPSET STOMACH AND MY DOG LOOKS FORWARD TO HER CHARCOAL BONE TREATS.
49,positive,29/3/21,"I highly recommend these very tasty Kavli Thin Crispbreads. I wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches. I hate whole wheat. I love rye. I saw these, noticed the ingredients couldn't get much simpler and gave them a try. Topped with cheese, or a sandwich spread or whatever you'd like they're very tasty. I feel as full after 2 or 3 of these, topped of course, as I did with just white bread. They're nice and thin so it isn't like biting into anything hard - just a nice crunch. The flavor isn't strong at all - it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past. Then I noticed that they are only 20 calories per slice. What's not to love? They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them. Oh - and they keep forever in the cupboard. I definitely will be buying these for a long time. :)"
50,positive,17/4/21,I'm very pleased with this dog food.  Haven't ordered anything else for my dogs since I bought this.  My lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and I'm happy that it is healthy for them.
51,positive,10/3/21,"I have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year, and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also. When I look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food, it is downright nauseating! I bought some of this Newman's Own and my dog loves it. She usually gobbles it up the minute I put it into the bowl."
52,positive,10/7/21,"I signed up for the monthly subscription for this item. The price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges. I love the fact that I can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled. Amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6"">Newman's Own¬Æ Organics Adult Dog Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>Very pleased with all my orders from Amazon. Extremely pleased with their customer service! THANKS AMAZON!"
53,positive,27/1/21,"I feel better about feeding this product to my dogs.  I was using another popular brand,<br />but it contained a lot of fillers.  One of my dogs is ""pickier,"" so he would prefer a meatier<br />taste, but he does clean it up eventually."
54,positive,1/6/21,"Our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by Trader Joe's.  You get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring.  Wow--it's a great snack that you feel good while eating.  It is my favorite of Trader Joe's almond snacks.  Almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein, the healthy fat and the Vitamin E that almonds offer. It's a good idea to measure out 1/4-1/2 cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within. Nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein."
55,positive,20/8/21,"I love these cookies. I am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what I look forward too. I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.<br /><br />When I eat them, I don't even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them. They don't make me crash either and feel like I ate junk food. It is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients. I wish I had these cookies close to me. I'd buy them every single day!"
56,positive,14/8/21,"The flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding(bluberry) and if there is  a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick (unlike this companys fig bars) and pastry textured.Flavored with cane  syrup(not fruit juice).150 cal per bar,and low in fat and the carbs(29) not too bad considering the great taste."
57,positive,21/4/21,"Of the Erin Baker products, the Fruit & Nut Mini Breakfast Cookie is my favorite!  I have one mini breakfast cookie (about 100 calories) with a cup of coffee in the morning and I feel satisfied and ready to start the day.  Very healthy, low in caloreis, and super delicious is what makes the product work for me.  Try it, you'll like it."
58,positive,1/4/21,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!"
59,positive,17/4/21,"These are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy, perfect with dips or salsa.  Tastes just like rice cake.  They are very easy on the teeth too, for those who have dental work that they don't want to chip. Hard to find in supermarkets."
60,positive,10/3/21,"This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!<br /><br />These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)<br /><br />Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.<br /><br />Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)<br /><br />Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola ""thins""  (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).<br /><br />Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)<br /><br />[...]  Exclusively"
61,positive,22/4/21,"If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack, Doctor Kracker is an answer.  However, the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth."
62,negative,25/4/21,"I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained Chicken Apple Compote Dinner. It contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others, although properly sealed, were solid and moldy and stinky.<br />One of the Turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it. I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.  It may prevent other babies from getting sick.<br />I'll never buy anything from Earth's Best again!"
63,positive,1/4/21,"Arrowhead Mills Organic Savory Herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey. I especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so I and my family can enjoy it without worry! The stuffing is very easy to prepare, but really adds to the meal. We use it all year long. Why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food?"
64,positive,30/6/21,"Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn't hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.<br /><br />I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout."
65,positive,1/3/21,"My dog has many food allergies, but these made-in-the-USA treats are free of wheat, corn, egg, and dairy.  My dog can't get enough of them."
66,positive,29/1/21,"4 Stars is a compromise between my rating of 2 and my grandchildren's rating of 5 stars.  I thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple/grape juice combo and light on the orange/tangerine flavor.  Also, it left a mild, canned aftertaste.  But my 9-year-old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda.  It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks. The can I was sent contained 8.3 ounces which is a better size for them than a regular 12 ounce can of soda.  For children, this is a tasty and healthy alternative."
67,positive,17/4/21,"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.<br /><br />Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.<br /><br />I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!<br /><br />While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference."
68,positive,10/3/21,"I love everything about this drink.  It's got plenty of carbonation.  Even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners, it's plenty sweet, without being too sweet.  I LOVE tangerine, and this has a very tangerine-y flavor and aroma.  If you love oranges or tangerines, this is the perfect drink for you.<br /><br />I ordered this from the Vine program out of curiosity, but it will be one of my ""must buy"" items in the future.  I'm also going to buy some for my grandchildren.  Since it has no added sugars, and I know they'll love it, it will be perfect for them."
69,positive,30/5/21,"I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.<br /><br />Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.<br /><br />I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.<br /><br />So this product is all the good things rolled into one:<br /><br />100% fruit juice<br />No added sugar<br />Bubbly<br />Awesome orange flavor<br /><br />It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy."
70,negative,28/9/21,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.<br /><br />Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract."
71,positive,6/5/21,I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though.
72,positive,20/4/21,"My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."
73,positive,20/4/21,"Sticks and Twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels, but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients, like flax seeds, quinoa, chia seeds and curry, are good for you. They are very crunchy, but tasty. For some added protein, I like to dip them in peanut butter."
74,positive,21/4/21,"Usually, healthy food is hard to swallow. Not these, fresh, crunchy, delicious pumpkin seeds. I switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate. What do I know? I'm taking her word for it."
75,positive,2/5/21,"I had never tried Bob's Red Mill pumpkin seeds although I have used and been very happy with many of their other products. I was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the USA. Most of the organic seeds are from China. The Bob's Red Mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in Oregon.<br /><br />I took the plunge and ordered 4 bags of these seeds, and they arrived in less than 48 hours.<br />Four sealed bags were also in a sealed Bob's Red Mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box.<br /><br />I just opened one bag of the seeds to try them. They are WAY better than what I was getting at my local whole food store in bulk. These seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off-taste.<br />These have a slight pumpkin taste, which they should have. This variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties I've had, which I like (no pointy ends to stab me as I'm munching them down).<br />All in all, a great buy!<br /><br />Seeds = 5 stars<br />Grown in the USA = 5 stars<br />Total = 10 stars!"
76,negative,25/5/21,"Gimme better ingredients (KIND/Larabars) for more $ or sweeter items (genuine junk) for less $. Not sure I'd invest in a single bar again, let alone this size."
77,positive,7/9/21,"I was very satisfied with my purchase of Nutiva hemp seeds. I ordered a 2-pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly. They taste great on their own, but I usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile, or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture. My supply is almost gone so I'll definitely be ordering more.<br /><br />One of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but I didn't find any in mine."
78,positive,25/5/21,I used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake. The taste is great and they are so healthy!!!
79,positive,22/5/21,"When I was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole, natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet, I was a bit skeptical.  I was not a huge almond fan to begin with.  I don't particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds.  Usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays.  The Whole Natural almonds by Blue Diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy.<br /><br />I like that they are a satisfying snack and I like the taste of them.  These are the ones I buy ... no added salt or anything.  Nice and fresh right out of the shell.<br /><br />5 stars."
80,positive,19/7/21,"If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are ""meaty"" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!"
81,positive,7/9/21,"I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!"
82,positive,25/8/21,"The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount."
83,positive,6/9/21,"These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though."
84,positive,25/5/21,"My review is for the Cinnamon cookie in the small bag.  I love them!!!  I do not have gluten issues, but I like the fact that the cookies are gluten free.  They are crunchy and satisfy my desire for something sweet.  Only 130 caloriesand 4.5 g of fat in three cookies.  Each pack has 4 cookies.  1.5 g of saturated fat, 0 trans fat, 0 cholesterol, 180 mg sodium, 1 g fiber, 21 g of carbs, and 2 g of protein.  Yummy, every bite.  Starbucks carries them sporadically, and I am so glad to be able to buy them from  Amazon!"
85,positive,7/9/21,"I love almonds in general, and this particular brand is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).<br /><br />They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA."
86,positive,13/10/21,"I was a skeptic about this product until I tried it with skim milk. This cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after 5 minutes of being soaked in milk. I enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor. I think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb, but so far, I find this cereal to have the highest fiber content. The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day!"
87,positive,2/10/21,"We were pleased with this salt. It's actually more salty than regular salt, even kosher salt or sea salt.  A little bit goes a long way!  I don't usually cook with it, but add it to things afterwards. I've been hand grinding it."
88,positive,23/9/21,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!<br /><br />I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!"
89,positive,26/6/21,"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!"
90,positive,25/5/21,"Ironically, I am an Amazon seasonal worker.  I discovered these tasty treats while working on the sales floor...I kept thinking, ""Wow, I sure ship alot of these things; WHAT are they?""  So I went home and checked them out on line for myself...I am a very active and healthy person.  I am ALWAYS looking for wholesome breakfast options; I have a hard time eating in the AM...These cookies are so filling and delish!!  I eat one at around 8 am and I am FINE until lunch...Healthy ingredients to fuel your busy day/lifestyle...I can't wait to put them in my back pack when I go hiking next!!!!"
91,positive,7/9/21,"Slightly biased because this company was started near my hometown, but I've been a fan of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies for years since I first noticed them popping up at coffee shops back home.  Now living on the other side of the country I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon, and even more excited to find them at such a great price!  Store them in the freezer, pop them in the toaster and it's like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch.  High in fiber and much better tasting than any energy bar out there, who doesn't love a cookie for breakfast?  I love these things, will be ordering more soon to keep our freezer well stocked!"
92,positive,15/7/21,"My dog loves these and everyone I have shared with agrees it's a great snack. Why feed grains and ""dog bones"" when you can offer a high protein healthy snack that promotes good health!"

94,positive,27/9/21,"After trying a number of other chocolate chip cookie mixes, my husband and I were beginning to wonder if any gluten, wheat and dairy free cookies could taste better than sawdust. Pamela's Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix was a revelation! Tastes as good as regular chocolate chip cookies,,,,delicious!"
95,positive,19/6/21,"These ""Whenever Bars"" taste like soft chocolate chip cookies. The coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting.<br /><br />Don't be deceived by the size of the package. The wrapper is much larger than the bar. Still, it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable 180 calories.<br /><br />I eat them around mid-morning or as a late night snack. I do not avoid gluten, wheat, or dairy (these bars are wheat-free, gluten-free, and non-dairy) but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats, agave, chia seeds, brown rice flour, etc.<br /><br />Once these become available in the Subscribe and Save program I feel certain I will subscribe. They are great to have around for a low calorie, sweet treat."
96,positive,25/5/21,These are even tastier than the original flavor! Works great in belgian waffle maker too! Why are they not priced right and available by subscription???
97,positive,7/9/21,"Finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do. These oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy. I originally found these in California while visiting family and could not find them in Virginia when I returned home. You have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the Internet,  and they are big bags, but I intend to share one with friends."
98,positive,3/8/21,"My husband and I have been making a serious effort to change our eating habits and be healthy, which is why I purchased this product. I was concerned about the highly processed vegetable oil we had been using, and the way the oil can become carcinogenic when cooked at high heat. Now, this is true for any oil; it should not be heated past it's "" smoke point "". Avocado oil has a very high smoke point, making it a perfect, healthy choice. It has healthy fats for your heart, and tastes yummy. I also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons. Amazon shipped these right away, and they were perfect. If you have a Misto, this is a great oil to put in it! We will definitely keep this on hand."
99,positive,5/9/21,"I have a senentary job, and like to munch on things. After steadily gaining weight, I decided that what I was munching on wasn't doing me any favors. Enter dried and bake dried fruit. There is no guilt if I polish off an entire bag in one sitting, although, I do try to refrain from doing so.  The Bare Fruit brand is great. Because these are baked dried, they are crunchy, like chips. And the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon. Because of the shrinkage, you can eat more than you mean to, but it is far better than eating anything artificial. Amazon's price is very competitive. I originally bought these from Marshall's and TJ Maxx for two dollars, twenty nine cents."
